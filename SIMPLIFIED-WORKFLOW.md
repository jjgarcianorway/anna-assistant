├── ci_smoke.sh                   ✗ Removed
├── collect_debug.sh              ✗ Removed
├── fix_v011_installation.sh      ✗ Removed
├── verify_installation.sh        ✗ Removed

```

### After (3 essential scripts only!)
```
scripts/
├── install.sh    ← Download & install from GitHub
├── release.sh    ← One-command commit + release
└── uninstall.sh  ← Remove Anna from system
```

**Deleted:** 2,983 lines of unnecessary code
**Kept:** Only what's essential

## 📥 Simplified Installer

### What Changed

**Before:** 500+ lines, complex fallback logic, mentions Cargo/Rust prominently

**After:** 287 lines, simple and clear

### New Installer Flow

```
1. Check if binaries already exist in ./bin/
   ↓ (not found)
2. Fetch latest release from GitHub API
   ↓
3. Download binaries for your architecture
   ↓
4. Extract binaries
   ↓
5. Install to system
   ↓
6. Done!
```

### Clear Error Messages

```bash
# If no releases exist yet:
✗ No releases found on GitHub yet

  The project maintainer needs to create a release first.
  Releases are created automatically when version tags are pushed.

  Check: https://github.com/jjgarcianorway/anna-assistant/releases
```

**No confusing Cargo/Rust errors!**

---

## 🚀 Your Complete Workflow

### Only ONE Command Needed

```bash
./scripts/release.sh -t patch -m "Your changes" --yes
```

### What It Does

```
1. Auto-commits all pending changes
2. Pushes to GitHub main branch
3. Bumps version (patch: 0.13.0 → 0.13.1)
4. Updates version in files
5. Creates release commit
6. Creates git tag v0.13.1
7. Pushes tag to GitHub
8. GitHub Actions builds binaries
9. Creates GitHub release
10. Users can install with: ./scripts/install.sh
```

**All automatic!**
