# Upgrade Summary v2 - Latest Release Auto-Fetching

## ✨ What You Asked For

> "Can the install just use the latest version uploaded? I mean without having the version hard coded in the URL? The idea is that you keep developing, we use the release.sh script to upload (why does it have a -t patch?) and after that, if we use the installer.sh it will try to download the latest version (the one we just uploaded"

## ✅ What Got Implemented

### 1. Installer Auto-Fetches Latest Release

**No more hardcoded versions!**

**How it works:**
1. Installer queries GitHub API: `https://api.github.com/repos/jjgarcianorway/anna-assistant/releases/latest`
2. Parses JSON to get latest tag (e.g., `v0.11.2`)
3. Downloads binaries from that release
4. **Always installs the latest version automatically!**

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No manual version updates needed
- ✅ Users always get the latest release
- ✅ Works seamlessly after each release

### 2. Semantic Versioning Explained

**Why `-t patch`?**

The `-t` parameter tells the script **how to bump the version number**.

Anna uses **semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**

```
0.11.1
│ │  └── patch (bug fixes)          Use: -t patch
│ └───── minor (new features)       Use: -t minor
└────── major (breaking changes)    Use: -t major
```

**Quick guide:**
- **Fixed a bug?** → `-t patch` (0.11.1 → 0.11.2)
- **Added a feature?** → `-t minor` (0.11.2 → 0.12.0)
- **Breaking change?** → `-t major` (0.12.0 → 1.0.0)

**Most common:** `-t patch` for everyday releases

## 🚀 Complete Workflow (Your Use Case)

### Step 1: Develop Features

```bash
# Make your changes
vim src/...
cargo build
cargo test

# Commit your work
git add -A
git commit -m "Add awesome feature"
```

---

### Step 2: Create Release (One Command!)

```bash
# For bug fixes
./scripts/release.sh -t patch -m "Fix installation bugs"

# For new features
./scripts/release.sh -t minor -m "Add telemetry dashboard"

# For breaking changes
./scripts/release.sh -t major -m "New config format"
```

**What happens:**
1. ✅ Detects current version (0.11.1)
2. ✅ Bumps version (→ 0.11.2)
3. ✅ Updates Cargo.toml and PKGBUILDs
4. ✅ Creates git commit
5. ✅ Creates git tag (v0.11.2)
6. ✅ Pushes to GitHub
7. ✅ GitHub Actions builds binaries (~10 min)
8. ✅ Binaries uploaded to release

---

### Step 3: Users Install (Always Gets Latest!)

```bash
# User runs installer
./scripts/install.sh

# Output:
# → Fetching latest release information...
# ✓ Latest release: v0.11.2              ← Automatic!
# → Downloading pre-compiled binaries...
# ✓ Downloaded and verified binaries
# ...installation continues...
```

**Users don't need to know the version - it's automatic!**

---

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before

**Maintainer (you):**
```bash
# Manual process (5+ minutes):
vim Cargo.toml              # Change version
vim scripts/install.sh      # Change version
vim packaging/aur/PKGBUILD  # Change version
git add -A
git commit -m "Release v0.11.2"
git tag -a v0.11.2 -m "..."
git push origin main
git push origin v0.11.2
# Wait for GitHub Actions...
```

**User:**
```bash
./scripts/install.sh
# Might download old version if you forgot to update install.sh
```

---

### After

**Maintainer (you):**
```bash
# One command (10 seconds):
./scripts/release.sh -t patch -m "Bug fixes"
# Everything else is automatic!
```

**User:**
```bash
./scripts/install.sh
# Always downloads the latest release automatically!
```

## 🎯 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Daily Development

```bash
# Monday: Fix a bug
git commit -m "Fix socket permissions"
./scripts/release.sh -t patch -m "Fix socket permissions bug"
# Users get v0.11.2

# Tuesday: Add new feature
git commit -m "Add backup command"
./scripts/release.sh -t minor -m "Add annactl backup command"
# Users get v0.12.0

# Users run: ./scripts/install.sh
# They always get the latest (v0.12.0) automatically!
```

---

### Example 2: Testing Before Release

```bash
# Test what will happen (dry run)
./scripts/release.sh -t patch -m "Bug fixes" --dry-run

# Output shows:
# Current version: 0.11.1
# New version: 0.11.2
# Files to update: Cargo.toml, PKGBUILDs
# Note: install.sh auto-fetches latest release (no update needed)

# If looks good, run for real:
./scripts/release.sh -t patch -m "Bug fixes"
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### How Latest Version Fetching Works

```bash
# 1. Fetch release info from GitHub API
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/jjgarcianorway/anna-assistant/releases/latest

# 2. Parse JSON (without jq dependency)
grep -o '"tag_name"[^,]*' | grep -o 'v[0-9.]*'
# Returns: v0.11.2

# 3. Construct download URL
https://github.com/jjgarcianorway/anna-assistant/releases/download/v0.11.2/anna-linux-x86_64.tar.gz

# 4. Download and install
curl -L -f -o binaries.tar.gz $url
tar -xzf binaries.tar.gz
```

**No hardcoded versions anywhere!**

---

### What Gets Updated During Release

**Automated by release script:**
- ✅ `Cargo.toml` - Rust workspace version
- ✅ `packaging/aur/PKGBUILD` - AUR source package
- ✅ `packaging/aur/PKGBUILD-bin` - AUR binary package

**No longer needs updates:**
- ✅ `scripts/install.sh` - Fetches latest automatically
