    "title": "I dumped Omarchy and went back to a fresh un-opinionated Arch",
    "body": "I gave it about 63 days before I gave up on it. 60 days ago I thought it was awesome. The past 2 weeks it was just annoying. When it became a bootable iso image I was pretty sure they were going to lose me. I didn't want a new distro. I wanted Arch with a a preconfigured Hyprland and development environment.\n\nI think it is kind of funny/sad how the mindset is is break free from your Mac and then they give you a version of Arch that is becoming more and more Mac like in the sense that you need to use Alacritty if you want these tui's to work right, and their modified chromium if you want these web apps to work right. And, oh I see you changed your keybinds, we're going to just change those back even though you did it the way we suggested. DHH has come up with some newer ones and you'll probably like them better than yours.  What? It changes your whole workflow? Funny you should mention that because we're also going to replace your neovim settings too. You might as well just do things our way.\n\nYeah I know it is an opinionated install, I didn't realize it was going to be opinionated updates as well. Just not for me. I did get some benefit from using it. I discovered lazygit and a few other terminal based applications.\n\nSo now that I am back to a fresh Arch install I figured I would give Cosmic a go. I must say I am pretty impressed with it. I like being able to set tiling or floating per work space.\n\n\\*edit\\*\n\nI had a 2nd PC with Omarchy installed, a little HP Mini. I ended up removing Omarchy tonight and keeping my Arch install by doing the following steps.\n\nDisable the Omarchy seamless login service and renable tty1\n\n    sudo systemctl stop omarchy-seamless-login.service\n    sudo systemctl daemon-reload \n    sudo systemctl start getty@tty1.service\n\nIt is easier if you log in on tty2 (ctrl-alt f2) to do this, When you stop the seamless login service it might kick you to a black screen. Once you get rid of the auto login you can also remove the omarchy decryption graphic and replace it with something prettier. You only need to do this if you are using an encrypted disk. If you aren't using LUKS just skip to the .config folder part.\n\n\"plymouth-set-default-theme -l\" will show a list of the themes. I went with bgrt which is basically the spinner theme with your bios or PC manufacturer's boot logo. You need to make sure you specify the -R flag so it will rebuild the initramfs.\n\n    sudo plymouth-set-default-theme -R bgrt\n\nAt this stage I decided to just move my .config folder and start with a fresh one. You don't have to do this part. If you decide to keep your .config folder and keep hyprland, there is a pretty good chance it will get updated back to omarchy again.\n\n    cd \n    mv .config/ .config.bak \n    mkdir .config\n\nThen I just copied over folders I wanted to preserve and omitted things I didn't mind rebuilding from scratch. Below are just some examples. One thing of note. Omarchy symlinks the themes to a lot of their stuff so if you copy nvim or any of your terminal customizations you might want to consider copying the omarchy folder. At the time of writing this, it only has a themes folder and a current theme folder.\n\n    cd .config\n    cp -r ../.config.bak/chromium .\n    cp -r ../.config.bak/retroarch .\n    cp -r ../.config.bak/nvim .\n\nYou can reboot here. You should get a new plymouth screen with the Arch logo at the bottom and whatever theme you picked\n\nFinally you need to get rid of the omarchy mirror and update your mirror list.\n\n    sudo nvim /etc/pacman.conf\n\nscroll down and comment out or remove these lines.\n\n    [omarchy] \n    SigLevel = Optional TrustAll \n    Server = https://pkgs.omarchy.org/$arch\n\nSave it and then run this to rebuild your mirror list\n\n    sudo pacman -Syyu\n\nAt this point you just need to do one more thing, remove omarchy-chromium\n\n    sudo pacman -R omarchy-chromium\n\nYou can re-install the real Chromium if you want it. Having the omarchy fork there will be problematic if you ever want to update Chromium.\n\nNow you are free to install whatever desktop and window manager you would like to use. If you install SDDM you can set that to auto login and go right into whatever you install.\n\nOmarchy is still going to exist in .local/share/omarchy as a git repo. I am keeping it there so I can cannibalize their themes. :)\n\nI hope this proves useful to some people and gets you back to just using Arch btw.",

    "body": "So I'm a 19 y/o CSE student, and I have been using Acer Aspire A315-58 for 2 years now, which comes with Windows pre-installed. I used to run Ubuntu WSL because I was initially a little curious about Linux and I wanted to do some low-level systems programming, which was really complicated with Windows.\n\nFurthermore, my laptop heats up very quickly when I just boot up Windows (task manager giving me ridiculous usage percentages), and I think on 5 different occasions, my screen just melted and glitched so I'd have to restart it or wait some time before I can use it.\n\nHowever, after gradually migrating most of my things to Arch Linux in May 2025, I can say that this is probably the greatest decision I ever made. Before Arch, I never imagined this would be possible:\n\n- Updating everything in my system with just a simple \"yay -Syu\"\n- Have a simple quick package manager that gets me all my essentials\n- Almost no stress on my CPU, GPU and RAM on boot\n- Everything I'll ever need is in less than 100 GB\n- No registry editor hell\n- No \"app is not on my laptop but it's still in my program list\" bs\n- Really high performance\n- I'm more aware about whats really happening to my laptop under the hood\n- Laptop doesn't heat up and send my fan to the damn ER\n- Custom keybinds that make me less reliant on my mouse\n\n...and the list just goes on, man.\n\nToday marks 6 months of me using Arch Linux (+ Hyprland), and I am very, very happy that I moved out of Windows. To be honest I only still kept Windows as a fallback, or when I can't use something on Arch, but 99% of my usage is on Arch.\n\nI really want to thank a lot of YouTube channels and the Arch and the overall Linux community for making this happen for me man, this is just awesome.",

My first OS was windows xp, then 7, then windows 8(hated that by the way), used windows 10 and 11.... I have used linux distros too in between like ubuntu and kali Linux in my school days. Didn't really liked ubuntu. I liked kali but went back to windows because games and other things weren't supported properly on Linux. I just found windows better overall. Now, after windows dropped their windows 11 i noticed my laptop got slower and it felt like windows was just trying to monetize everything by showing me ads and useless info. Taskbar was filled with bunch of crap i never used. I saw PewDiePie video of him switching to Linux and thought maybe i should try it too for real and not just dual boot it and then come back to windows and i installed arch on my laptop and used hyprland. It was Fun trying to figure it out. It was kind of silly using terminal to change my brightness, breaking it and reinstalling it again🤣 soon after some time i got some hand of it. Experimented a little with dotfiles then found a project on GitHub called Hyde desktop environment, tried it, liked it, and then just used that till now. It's been more than 5 months now and recently i tried using windows on my friend's laptop and mannnn....it just felt soo slow...like...using mouse to move my cursor and then clicking on apps to open them...yuckkkkkk 🤣🤣 sounds kinda funny but i didn't expect that using arch for some months would make me hate windows soo much...i couldn't believe I used to use that shit for soo long... In uni while all struggle to set up virtual environments for their python project i do it in seconds in my terminal. Everything still doesn't work perfectly out of box on Linux but still the fact that you can just fix it is soo amazing.. and now with all the tools like chatgpt, if you have any problem just copy all the errors from terminal and it'll guide you step by step how to fix it. Using arch has completely changed my perspective on how you should use a computer and how OS should be meant to serve you....now I can't even imagine going back to windows or use any other os like mac os",

I was about to upgrade my PC anyway so why not experiment? In a call with my friends I said that I’m done with the Microsoft crap and I left the call and immediately went to install arch. And post install it was just as good as I thought it would be, I started with KDE, downloaded all my stuff, transferred files and it all worked perfectly.

I’ve been using Ubuntu on WSL for several years now to access tools I use for my teaching and research that are a pain to get running on Windows, but lately I’ve been running into more and more issues which I chalked up to outdated packages, but is more likely than not due to my own haphazard setup.\n\nOn a whim, I decided to give Arch Linux a shot. After some amusing misunderstandings (where’s `vi`? …where’s `nano`? …where’s `man`?!) I finally have it up and running with current versions of my research tools. It feels so much smoother than trying to run things through Ubuntu so far, and I’m considering having my students with Windows laptops make use of it for my courses too (Octave and Sage for everyone!).\n\nAnd many thanks to all the folks who have contributed to the Arch Wiki. Pretty much all of my beginner questions had easy to find answers on the wiki, and the level of detail was perfect for someone who knows how to use basic terminal commands but not much else. \n\nNow I want to get a laptop to put Arch Linux on.

    "title": "2 years in and I finally feel somewhat knowledgable",
    "body": "So I had to nuke some harddrives (dealing with someone who got access to my google accounts, and potentially my computer(s), so had to go scorched earth on my setup.  Was painfully necessary unfortunately) and I had gotten more than a little lazy when it comes to security.  So when I started rebuilding my setup I installed Arch onto an encrypted thumbdrive and used BTRFS (BTRFS isn't the fastest solution for an operating system on a USB thumbdrive by the way) with separate subvolumes for the logs, var, home, and root folders.  This made for a great setup for snapshots, but I really wasn't considering the implications for when I eventually migrated from a thumbdrive to an SSD.\n\n  \nCut to a few days ago, I finally decide to buy a new NVME SSD for my laptop (I wasn't the only person hacked, and the authorities have been involved, so I'm fairly sure that this person won't be making any further moves moving forward, if I had to guess) and legitimize my Arch install.  I also wanted to get more space and speed things up--even with a barebones Arch install using Hyprland, the speed for random reads and writes is pretty abysmal, and I am usually doing development on my PC's these days.\n\n  \nSo I go to migrate my install and realize...this is a bit more complicated than a simple 'rsync -aHAXS /mnt/source /mnt/target'.  Having to recreate the filesystem, setup the encryption, copy all of the subvolumes, ensure that everything interacts with everything else correctly is a bit, well, intense, all things considered.\n\nHowever, after a day or so of transferring (good god usb thumbdrive's are slow.  Less than 1 million files and 220GB took literally 24 hours to fully copy) and a couple hours of setup, I unplugged my thumbdrive on reboot, sure I'd absolutely fucked up SOMETHING along the way but...\n\n  \nShe boots.  No problems, no missing anything, no hitches, everything in place.  Even my browser history and tmux settings are in tact.  Literally everything is there and everything works.  For the first time since I switched to Linux 2 years ago, I've successfully completed a somewhat complicated operation, with zero problems, zero issues, and zero caveats.\n\nI know in the grand scheme of things, this is somewhat minor.  But I just feel like I finally achieved some base level of competency in Linux that I'd spent decades at in Windows.  I did my first data migration when I was 12 years old in Windows, and while it's a bit simpler in an unencrypted Windows 98 installation than it is in pretty much any Arch Linux installation, still.  Just feels good.\n\n  \nAnyways, that's all I got.  Silly?  Sure.  But my foray into learning Linux started with Ubuntu (ugh) and, even though Arch is better, it's MUCH more intricate for doing things that matter.  I've only recently started using regex regularly, I picked up neovim finally a few months ago, and it took me almost a year to even try tmux.  Normally it wouldn't take this long, but the whole reason I began learning Linux was because I was getting into machine learning and trying to figure out how to utilize, make, and dissect LLMs and see what makes them tick--so it was buy a used Mac or install Linux.  Linux is/was the 'free' option, so that became my go-to.  I dual booted for a year, and only recently decided to go Arch only.  I finally feel comfortable editing config service files, and the only time I refer to documentation is when trying out new software.  I've learned how to use cmake/ninja/bazel/git (although I'm still somewhat novice with these, I can use them functionally), and I even branched out from Python to relearn some C++ and mess around with Zig.\n\n  \nI'm far from a guru, but I do like being competent, at the very least.  I need to learn more about the base programs/services that (most) Linux distributions ship with (like sed, grep, and others--I still just use grep for 'grep -r \"\\[search query\\] .\" and the like, ,or 'ps aux | grep' or 'lsmod | grep' etc etc; basic stuff), but I at least have a grasp on all of the different things that CAN be done.  From there it's just a quick --help or google search to figure out how to do what I want to do.\n\n  \nI dunno, it's just nice to have done all this myself, put the onus on myself to learn everything I have (I have had no job, school, or other outside influence on me to pick any of this up--in fact, I spent 90% of my free time playing competitive video games before all of this, so learning to program and to use Linux was more than a bit of a left turn all things considered), and it's beginning to pay off in some really rewarding ways.\n\n  \nP.S. setting up a tmux/bash script to display CPU/GPU/RAM/VRAM/DISK utilization in my status bar has been probably my favorite part of it all.  Customizing tmux is super fun, and keeping my eye on all of that hardware information keeps me from having to have htop/btop open in an adjacent pane while running various programs.\n\n  \nThanks for reading my blog /s",

I kept windows just in case I ever needed it but right now I don't think I need windows 11 anymore as I can't even remember the last time i booted into windows. So i am considering doing a full wipe and fresh arch installation. I have gone through manual installation but for convenience I am thinking of giving archinstall a try. What i need in my fresh installation are:\n\n1. encryption ( i never did disk encryption, i always sticked to arch installation wiki but I think encryption would be good moving forward ).\n\n2. Switch to systemd-boot from grub as i am moving away from dual boot. \n\n3. I used to use zram so there was no swap partition but later switched to zswap as I found out it was already enabled in Arch and used swapfile with btrfs recommended method. I plan to create a swap partition now and use zswap with it.\n\n4. I just want the minimal installation option, I will setup niri with my configs later as post installation.\n\nI used snapper with btrfs previously but it has been 4 years since my last arch installation. So, is archinstall good enough or should i invest a little time to know what's standard best practices are right now and go with manual installation for better results?\n\n\nEdit: \n\nI just went with archinstall script. Turns out, the script is pretty flexible and lets you skip part that you don't want it to do. I just let it handle the tedious part and did some manual work to make the installation customized to my interest. \n\nBut i do agree that it is not for new users. In my opinion, Arch should be installed in an opinionated way. If you are just going to install whatever recommended without much thought, using Arch will be same as using any other linux distribution. Linux comes with a lot of options and unlike other distribution, Arch lets you cherry pick each and every part of it. Take advantage of it when you can, use the wiki. \n\nArchinstall script is pretty good when you know what you are doing. ",

    "body": "This is for **Nvidia** users. I ran into an issue recently where my system would go back to sleep after waking. Really frustrating, but after traversing the journal and doing some poking, I found the solution and I figured I would share it for posterity.\n\nMaybe this is just super obvious for everyone, but (as a somewhat novice Arch user) it wasn't for me.\n\nSystem specs:\n\nKernel: **Linux 6.17.5-arch1-1**\n\nDE: **Gnome 49.1**\n\nWM: **Mutter (Wayland)**\n\nGPU: **Nvidia**\n\nDriver: **nvidia-dkms**\n\n\nVery simple fix. I found an older update to how systemd sleep worked, and it reads as such:\n\n&gt;The behavior of systemd-sleep and systemd-homed has been updated to freeze user sessions when entering the various sleep modes or when locking a homed-managed home area. This is known to cause issues with the proprietary NVIDIA drivers. Packagers of the NVIDIA proprietary drivers may want to add drop-in configuration files that set SYSTEMD\\_SLEEP\\_FREEZE\\_USER\\_SESSIONS=false for systemd-suspend.service and related services, and SYSTEMD\\_HOME\\_LOCK\\_FREEZE\\_SESSION=false for systemd-homed.service.\n\nSo.. I just set this to `TRUE` to prevent the race condition of some component settling or stray power event to retrigger the suspend again.\n\nI just edited the services `sudo systemctl edit` to prevent this against future updates:\n\n* systemd-suspend.service\n* systemd-hibernate.service\n* systemd-suspend-then-hibernate.service\n* systemd-hybrid-sleep.service\n\nI set what the template showed in those files, pasting in the appropriate area:\n\n    [Service]\n    Environment=SYSTEMD_SLEEP_FREEZE_USER_SESSIONS=1\n\nAnd now my system operates normally not going back to sleep after waking. Hopefully this helps somebody with the same issue. Maybe there is a better way to go about this, and maybe this wont work for everyone - I am definitely open to adjusting my logic here and seeing what I could do differently.\n\n**Edit:** So this works persistently. But, I found an edge case where even with this fix, I still have the system going back to sleep quickly after a wake. I think I’ve narrowed it down to application noise (in my specific case, I think it’s something to do with Spotify).\n\nAs soon as I zero in on the issue - as I am not sure if it’s specific to Nvidia, Wayland, gnome or something else, I’m going to do a write up on the fix and link the post here.\n\nIf you’re coming across this post, and your issue is _a blank screen on wake_, then this post is not covering a fix for that.

I'm about to have a mental breakdown over this.\n\n​I've been trying to get a stable Arch install on my laptop for months. I've reinstalled this thing 10-12 times. Whenever I use ext4, it's pretty stable. But I wanted to do things the \"right\" way with Btrfs and Snapper for snapshots.\n\n​Every. Fucking. Time. I use Btrfs, I get random hard system freezes. The screen just locks, audio stops, and I have to hard reboot. The logs (journalctl -b -1) show nothing. They just stop at the time of the freeze.\n\n​I've been working day and night trying to fix this. I feel like I'm losing my mind. The time and stress I've put into this is uncountable.\n\n​Here is my hardware:\n​Laptop: ASUS ROG STRIX G513RC\n\n​CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 6800H with Radeon Graphics\n\n​GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3050 Mobile\n\n​RAM: 16GB DDR5\n\n​Disk: Micron NVMe SSD\n\n​Here is EVERYTHING I have done to try and fix this.\n\n​Suspected the Kernel: Thought the standard linux kernel was the problem.\n\n​Action: Switched to linux-lts and nvidia-lts.\n​Result: Still froze.\n\n​Suspected Drivers/Config:\n​Action: Fixed my GRUB config to actually boot the LTS kernel (it wasn't). Set it as the default (GRUB_DEFAULT=0).\n\n​Action: Updated /etc/mkinitcpio.conf to load all graphics drivers (amdgpu, nvidia, nvidia_drm) in the initramfs for early KMS.\n​Result: It looked cleaner, but it still fucking froze.\n\n​Suspected the Btrfs Swap File: This seemed like the \"smoking gun.\"\n​Action: I checked /etc/fstab and my Btrfs swap subvolume was missing nodatacow. I added it, turned swap off, remounted, and turned it back on. I verified with mount | grep /swap that nodatacow was active.\n\n​Result: I was so happy. I thought it was solved. IT STILL FUCKING FROZE.\n\n​Suspected the Hardware (Disk):\n​Action: Installed smartmontools and ran sudo smartctl -a on my NVMe.\n\n​Result: PASSED. The drive is 100% healthy. 0 errors, 100% available spare.\n\n​Suspected the BIOS/Firmware: I saw some ACPI BIOS Error (bug) messages on boot.\n​Action: Went to the ASUS support site for my G513RC.\n\n​Result: My BIOS is already on the latest version.\n\n​Suspected the Hardware (RAM): This was the final boss. I was told Btrfs is heavy on RAM and could be hitting a bad cell that ext4 never touched. I was sure this was it.\n\n​Action: Made a bootable Memtest86+ USB. I let it run.\n\n​Result: Pass: 1, Errors: 0. My RAM is perfectly, 100% fine.\n\n​So now what?\n\n​I'm just tired, dude. I've proven it's not the kernel. It's not the drivers. It's not the swap file config. It's not the disk. It's not the BIOS. And it's not the RAM.\n\n​The only goddamn variable left is Btrfs itself.\n​I'm a beginner, but I did all the \"professional\" steps. I'm just trying to have a stable system with snapshots. Is that too much to ask?\n​Is Btrfs just cursed on some hardware? Is this a known issue with my ASUS laptop or this Ryzen CPU? Am I missing anything?\n\n​I'm 100% ready to just say \"fuck Btrfs\" and go back to my stable ext4 install. Please, any suggestions from you pros? I'm desperate.\n\n​Arch on Btrfs hard-freezes. Already fixed nodatacow swap, on LTS kernel, smartctl passed, BIOS is updated, and Memtest86+ passed with 0 errors. I'm out of ideas. Is ext4 my only hope?\n\nEDIT / SOLVED:\n\nSystem is finally stable now — no more random freezes or shutdowns.\n\nThe issue was caused by having a swap file on the same Btrfs partition that used compression (compress=zstd:3).\nWhen RAM filled up, the kernel tried to compress swap data, which caused instant system freezes with no logs or errors.\n\nFix:\n\nBooted into GParted\n\nShrunk main Btrfs partition\n\nCreated a new 16 GB dedicated Linux-swap partition\n\nAdded its UUID to /etc/fstab\n\n\nAlso switched to the LTS kernel and replaced discard=async with fstrim.timer.\n\nTip for others:\nIf you face random freezes on Btrfs, don’t use a swap file on a compressed partition.\nCreate a proper swap partition instead — it fixes the problem completely.",

If someone has one of those cards and has installed the proprietary Nvidia driver, what happens when the new driver is released and a person updates their system through pacman? I can’t see any way that pacman would know not to update the driver. I do see that drivers for older architectures are included in AUR. Can a package be “frozen” so it doesn’t update and then allow for an admin to switch to the AUR package before a system update causes a system breakage?",

In that vain, I've found that once these packages are updated, the issue returns - they are:  \nalsa-lib-1.2.14-2  graphviz-14.0.2-1  lib32-alsa-lib-1.2.14-2  lib32-libdrm-2.4.127-1

This is useful after a large file copy. Disk write cache and swap both stay full and the system actually slows down. i don't know why Linux doesn't automatically release this memory after a large file copy is complete. But it doesn't for whatever reason. This set of commands dumps the cache and reclaims that memory. It gives the computer a bit of a boost. It's quite noticeable on lower end hardware.\n\nTrim: trims all volumes.\n\nupdate: updates repo packages and aur packages, the default behavior for paccache is to keep the last three packages in cache and clear the rest. I do this to save disk space. I can always roll back beyond that with the downgrade tool if need be. Updates snap and flatpaks. I don't' have any snaps installed. But i have that in the command just in case i ever do.\n\nInstall / remove: pretty obvious what those do.\n\nfind: searches the repo and aur for packages.\n\nbuild: tells it to build an AUR package\n\nClean: displays orphaned packages from both pacman and yay and prompts you to remove them.\n\nOrphans: only list the orphans, does not remove them.\n\nRank: uses reflector to search for and rank mirrors. \n\nAnyways. that's what i got.

Unfortunately, I had to switch to Windows for work — and after about five or six years of it, I’ve had enough. I really miss my Arch + Hyprland setup and would love to go back.\n\nSo, has anyone figured out a good workflow for this?

    "body": "I have been using some version of Linux as my daily driver for more than two years now. For just over a year, it's been Garuda Linux. I left Windows mostly because I really am over the privacy issues with Windows 11 and I also detest being treated like a recurring revenue stream on an operating system I paid full price for. \n\nI gave my old gaming desktop to my kids to play games on the TV with and it still runs Windows 11. The kids mostly play games on Steam family accounts.\n\nI'm pretty sure at this point they won't care what operating system the gaming desktop uses. They care that they can play their games. So I'm down to two issues preventing the swap to Linux for the kids.\n\nIssue #1: We have a Quest 3 that the kids and I use infrequently. Getting it to work at all in Linux proved to be an exceptionally painful experience. I had varying levels of success with different online tutorials and it took several hours to get through that. When I did finally get the Quest 3 to work, it was still an inferior experience to Steam VR and Windows Mixed Reality, requiring sometimes significant tweaks to be able to interact with the game at all. For the moment, this is one isn't the end of the world. A lot of the stuff we play with Steam VR can be played natively on the headset though this does have the disadvantage of severely decreasing the headset's battery life.\n\n  \nIssue #2: Game controller support appears to be spotty. It could be the controllers. I purchased relatively cheap controllers from Gamesir. That way, if\\\\when the kids busted one, either through just not knowing how to take care of a game controller or via sudden rage induced mechanical failure, it wouldn't be that big of a deal. The problem we've run into is that getting more than two controllers working at the same time appears to be some combination of chanting the correct incantation and only using them during specific planetary alignments of Jupiter and Mars. Essentially, we can usually get two working reliably but a 3rd is asking a lot. It's not an issue we had with the same controllers on the same games in Windows 11. I'm open to the idea that the cheap controllers just won't work well in Linux and as my kids are a bit older now(13, 12, 9), I'd be willing to invest in some better quality controllers if I knew they'd work well with Linux.\n\nAny thoughts on the above? I'd love to ditch Windows entirely but I do understand that most manufacturers of hardware and software still develop primarily for Windows.  \n",

Used the CTT debloat tool to transform a bloated, telemetry collecting win11 iso to an incredibly minimal windows iso and installed it onto winboat + ran the ctt debloat tool AGAIN to kill all the shitty windows services no one asked for.... Installed fl studio and now need a way to access my sounds within the VM without giving windows access to the home folder :D\n\n\n\n\n\nI've decided to switch to arch linux. As a complete beginner I understand that this is a risky move, but I desire to learn and grow through this journey.\n\nI had to leave behind windows because i couldn't make a partition big enough for my linux endeavor, so I decided to just install arch on the whole drive: I used archinstall, encrypted the ssd and I'm using the hardened linux kernel bc I'd like to bring some privacy and digital security back into my life (i did install and activate a firewall too).\n\nNow, I bought and I've been using Fl Studio for quite some time and after looking at a couple of wine tutorials, specific for this topic, I thought I could get it working. I did get it to work somewhat, but got quite a few errors and unfortunately don't have an audio interface compatible with linux.\n\nMy 2 main questions are:\n\n1. Is it possible to get it working, perhaps using a solution like \"bottles\" and routing my audio properly using carla (or something a bit more intuitive) in a way that works?\n2. would it be a viable option to dualboot windows on the same encrypted ssd without having to start over from scratch (which I wouldn't mind too much)?\n\nI'll provide some extra information if needed and any help would be highly appreciated...\n\nSome extra info I feel might be useful for you to know: running kde plasma 6, i set up timeshift on this partition using RSYNC, BTRFC file structure...\n\nI set it all up today so I will take all recommendations into consideration and I'm willing to start fresh and vanilla arch is not a must as long as I'm able to customize everything and make music :)\n\nThank you so unbelievably much in advance and whether you help me or are just passing by, thank you for existing!",

And then during the process it knocked me out of my X session and every log in attempt my screen would blink for half a second and I would be back in my login screen. I shut my laptop down and turned it back on, and I got an error message about modules.devname not found in /lib/\"xxx\"/arch and I was left in a terminal with my name replaced with rootfs. None of the commands would work like nvim or pacman, and I honestly have no idea what that error was so please let me know if you guys know what that means. I'm just gonna talk about how I got back into arch and how I'm making this post.\n\nFirst, I wiped the dust off my usb stick and got back into the live environment. I mounted my partitions with the mount command, and entered my system through arch-chroot.\n\nThen, I reinstalled grub. Apparently that's how somebody else solved this issue back in 2018 so I thought I would give it a try. I ran grub-install pointing to my boot partition and efi directory, and remade my config with grub-mkconfig. All of this went with no errors. I rebooted the system and now my Arch Linux entry was gone.\n\nSo I chrooted back into my system and used efibootmgr to remove all the useless entries and made a new entry pointing to my new grubx64.efi. It was located in /boot/EFI/EFI/GRUB for some reason. If anybody knows whether it's fine to have two EFI folders or if I should be concerned for the future please let me know also.\n\nAnd I rebooted, and everything was working fine and normal again. So basically the solution was to reinstall grub, remake the config, use efibootmgr to make sure my system finds arch\n\nHopefully if anybody else runs into the same problem as me it helps a little bit.",

    "title": "My Arch Journey ~ A Linux Newbie",
    "body": "# Preface\n\nI have never ever tried Arch before, and I am dying to express my journey to *somebody.*  \nTurns out, people get bored incredibly quickly when I start talking about arch :)\n\nSo this might be a slightly long post, please bear with me. Hope this might in someway help someone.\n\n# Chapter 1 - First Install\n\nFrom what I have heard the one and only guide for installation you need is [\"The Wiki\"](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide)\n\nI have read a lot of documentations, none of them as \"complete\" as this one. It has everything that one might ever need. It just needs to be searched thoroughly.\n\nI installed an extremely basic installation but I got lost on what packages to install. Getting confused with what a DE is what SDDM does and so on.\n\nI wanted to just get some sort of a setup started so I followed [this](https://gist.github.com/mjkstra/96ce7a5689d753e7a6bdd92cdc169bae)\n\nI have never worked with btrfs file system. But I thought I'll give it a shot. The author mentions that we need to create sub volumes of @ and @ home. (Which I completely ignored because I thought it wasn't important and went ahead with my 2 separate partitions for each)\n\nBIG MISTAKE\n\n# Chapter 2 - Timeshift\n\nSo now I got the hang of Arch,\n\n* Installed KDE, downloaded themes mix and matched stuff\n* Installed a theme for my GRUB\n   * (Also modified it using grub-customizer by removing unecessary entries and re-ordering other entries (Linux Mint &amp; Windows). Another mistake BTW.\n* Setup few other packages that I require and was quite happy with my setup.\n\nNow, I wanted to save it. The github author of the installation guide suggested timeshift worked amazing with btrfs. So I wanted to try timeshift!\n\nTurns out, you *require* @ and @ home directories since that is the setup timeshift expects (for reasons unknown)\n\nThe Fix:  \nI won't go into too many details but basically,\n\n1. Created a copy of my root partition in \"@\" via the btrfs snapshot feature.\n2. Created a new subvolume \"@ home\" and copied my home partition into it (Please note to use `cp -rp` . Don't ask how I know)\n3. Generated my fstab file again (Please note to remove previous entries in the file and not just use the `&gt;&gt;` as mentioned in the wiki. Again, don't ask.)\n4. Generate the grub.cfg file again (And as much as I liked grub-customizer earlier. I HATED it here. It does something to the files which kind of break the generation of grub.cfg, it does not go to the vanilla configuration. Please note, just manually modify the grub.cfg for your OCD instead of messing with grub-customizer IMO)\n5. Finally, system was booting and mounted correctly, I still had my complete setup. Now I just cleaned the rest of the stuff up by deleting the previous locations of the root and home directory (gparted is pretty cool too!)\n\nPhew,\n\n# Chapter 3 - Nvidia\n\nNow, the only problem that I was having with my setup (now that it was completely backed up), was that I could only run 60Hz on my monitor. From most inferences I see online, it seems that installing nvidia drivers seems to have resolved the problem.\n\nLet me just begin this by saying thank god I figured out timeshift earlier. So that I can make instant undos / redos here!\n\n# Chapter 3.1 - ???\n\nThat's a wiki reference for you all (the 3.1 get it?). Anyways so I started here: [https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA)\n\nNow I think I'll get some backlash for this, but to my untrained eye, this is THE most confusing of the Arch Wiki pages I have seen. (Totally didn't start reading Arch Wiki like a week back \\\\s)\n\nI got to the first step and installed nvidia-open and the later steps just confused the heck out of me. From what I could understand, I had to install the package nvidia-open and somehow set modeset=1 somewhere. I tried understanding the page for half an hour when I gaveup and just rebooted my system.\n\nTo my surprise, my monitor started working at 120 Hz right away! Big win right there.\n\n# Chapter 3.2 - The reboot\n\nI shutdown my system, came back a day later only to see that SDDM had not even loaded.  \n(BTW another note: ctrl + alt + f3 lets you login via TTY3)\n\nI saw the `journalctl -b` and saw some log saying \"nvidia-gpu i2c timeout error\". Still no idea what it means.\n\nI tried the following to fix:\n\n* upgraded all packages\n* Downgraded nvidia-open and nvidia-utils (Another note: You can use the downgrade package to downgrade stuff. Also note, you can specify multiple packages in a single downgrade command to simultaneously downgrade packagase that depend on each other)\n* Installed nvidia-exec (nvx). It did solve the problem by shutting down my nvidia gpu entirely so that the system runs on my integrated card. But that is hardly a solution (this time I couldn't even start the screen of my monitor with the integrated gpu)\n\nAnyway, nothing worked, until I stumbled upon this page:\n\n[https://forum.manjaro.org/t/how-to-add-nvidia-drm-modeset-1-kernel-parameter/152447](https://forum.manjaro.org/t/how-to-add-nvidia-drm-modeset-1-kernel-parameter/152447)\n\nWhere the user \"nikgnomic\" kindly \"spelled out\" how to set the modeset=1.\n\n# Chapter 3.3 - Sigh\n\nI thought it worked. However, just when I was opening my laptop to write this post, it happened again. Sometimes rebooting fixes the issue, still not sure about the cause of the problem though.\n\nPlease share any things I can try here.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis is the BEST experience of linux I have had ever. I am not sure why. Perhaps it is because I built it myself or maybe because of how much I got to learn along the way. I had tons of fun!\n\nI would highly recommend anyone who is somewhat familiar with Linux or has the time to learn and read to install Arch.\n\nLook forward to being part of the Arch community!\n\nLife update (5 Nov):\n\nI finally got Nvidia to work!! wohoo. Turns out, early loading of the nvidia modules is a must. Oh well, the more you know.",

So am the tech, my friend in Vermont calls me last night frantic cause his PC Arch just got messed up and doesn't know how to even begin to reinstall.\n\nI start talking to chatgpt.. yes chatgpt.. and it gave me an idea for him to open a port on his router so I can ssh to him on the usb live Arch installation. He doesn't have access to the router.. so chatgpt tells me to do reverse ssh, let him connect to me and then I can connect to him..\n\nSo to conclude this story, I don't know what F***$&amp;$ry of magic I pulled out of my A*&amp;!! But I was able to install Linux on his machine, from South Florida to Vermont or Connecticut some where up north 3 hours from Boston... partition and all and got him up and running, In like 30mins, with setting up the reverse ssh..\n\nWe both were screaming on the phone and the wives were like what is up with you guys.. and we were like: OMG!!!!OMG!! OMG!!\n\nI love this OS and the roller coaster of learning experience I have learned in the past 2 years, Microsoft can't get me back even if they payed me.. even my son yesterday after what he saw wiped his windows is and install cachyos and got all his games up and running..\n\nThis for me as of yesterday had turned into the god tier OS... the more I learn, the better it gets.. everyone I have helped is grateful.. everything just works!! Linux is one truly awesome OS.. \n\nYear 1 was learning year, you will mess up, but instead of feeling defeated learn from that moment, it's growing pains.. MS has brain washed us to believe that the issues it has is normal.. OS tweaks and it's not... In Linux you will also learn, cause that is what we do learn in life.. And once it clicks..

The reason I am asking for help here, is because I know that certain nvidia drivers are tied directly to the kernel versions, and a mismatch can result in even bigger problems.\n\nHow can I accurately downgrade my nvidia module from 580.105.08 to 580.95.05?\n\nI am aware I can use the `downgrade` tool, but what modules specifically need to be targeted (lib-\\*, nvidia-\\*, etc)? Does it have to be every single one, or just a few specific modules? Would I also need to downgrade my kernel, or can it stay the same (as there were no ABI changes in the recent update)?\n\nI am assuming it is just `lib32-nvidia-utils` (580.105.08), `libva-nvidia-driver` (0.0.14 - irrelevant?), `linux-firmware-nvidia` (20251021-1 - irrelevant?), `nvidia-dkms` (580.105.08), `nvidia-settings` (580.105.08), `nvidia-utils` (580.105.08).\n\nThank you.",

    "body": "I was very interested to see what performs best in games, regardless of Wayland or X11\n\nSo, I tried Cinnamon first, and honestly had probably the worst latency in games, I play competitive shooters, and I was playing Source Engine title to see how it is, since I know how it feels so well on Windows 11 too.\n\nInterestingly enough Cinnamon in Arch does not feel as responsive as Cinnamon in Linux Mint I had installed before\n\nThen I tried Gnome, although Arch performs moderately good in Gnome at the desktop level, gaming itself feels a bit sluggish, but less so than Cinnamon. I even tried Cinnamon Wayland, but sluggish behavior was still there. I tried Gnome X11 and Gnome Wayland, both performed good at desktop level, but slow in games. It felt like I was constantly behind in mouse response.\n\nI then proceeded to move to XFCE to test how it was after Gnome, and XFCE on X11 is the best I have tried\n\nResponsiveness is truly the best out of DEs that I tried, mouse feels very responsive to clicks in games and movement feels very good\n\nSeeing XFCE perform so well definitely surprised me, but what surprised me more is that Cinnamon integration into Arch is simply worse than Linux Mint integration of Cinnamon.\n\nI would say Linux Mint Cinnamon is on par with Arch Gnome, but Linux Mint Cinnamon still beats out Arch Gnome in responsiveness of games, and overall smoothness.\n\nAnother issue I have encountered with Cinnamon in Arch is that restarting PC and trying to get into Steam would result into an issue getting into Steam. Although, it was working a restart prior. No matter how much I tried to reinstall Steam, the issue remained.\n\nI would say in some cases (perhaps hardware based) Cinnamon is not integrating well with Arch, at least for me. There is definitely a visual stutter and sluggishness with Cinnamon for me. Cinnamon was solo installed on Arch by me as native DE.\n\nThen I proceeded to install the rest of DEs manually\n\nI am not a huge chaser of frames per second, as much as smoothness and frame pacing, and XFCE is amazing with Arch for gaming.\n\nInteresting enough for me was the fact that for some people Cinnamon runs flawlessly with Arch, but not with my hardware.\n\nInterestingly enough Linux Mint holds it's own with Cinnamon with that Ubuntu base\n\nArch is cool, you can install basically any DE at your fingertips with a command, but mileage definitely varies depending on hardware. I expected Cinnamon to perform just as reliable as Mint, but on Arch, but it wasn't the case. I really like Cinnamon visually and functionally, but I will stick to Linux Mint if I was to use Cinnamon.\n\nAs a side note I turned off compositor for all of these DEs to keep the latency as low as possible.\n\nIf anyone truly wants to test the best DE for your system, I really suggest installing one DE, and then installing all the ones you want to try on top of the OS, and switch to each while at the login screen. Then find the best one and uninstall the other instances\n\nResults may vary, and in my case the drastic difference was likely tied to my hardware more than DE or Arch itself.",

    "body": "EDIT: If you're using disk encryption and switching to a systemd-based ramdisk, you need to change your kernel boot parameters. What worked for me was to replace cryptdevice=UUID=*uuid-1234*:root with rd.luks.name=*uuid-1234*=root in /etc/default/grub and run grub-mkconfig.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday I updated mkinitcpio to version 40, and pacman added a new config file. I merged it with pacdiff and ran `mkinitcpio -P`. After that I rebooted and GRUB was stuck at \"loading initial ramdisk\" stage for what I think was a couple minutes. I then got an error saying that it timed out waiting for my disk device.\n\nAnyway, I have then spent the next hour troubleshooting, and it turned out that I forgot to add the `sd-encrypt` hook. However, that still did not fix my problem, and I'm really not sure what's wrong. I've rebuilt my initramfs with an old config and it works fine.\n\nOld hooks: `HOOKS=(base udev autodetect microcode modconf kms keyboard keymap consolefont block encrypt filesystems fsck)`  \nNew hooks: `HOOKS=(base systemd autodetect microcode modconf kms keyboard sd-vconsole sd-encrypt block filesystems fsck)`  \nEverything else is the same.\n\nAdditional information: I use btrfs with an encrypted root partition and unencrypted boot partition.

I used to use MusicBee, that would transfer music files based on their rating (i.e. my favourite music) to my phone and would also delete songs, that are not in the playlist anymore.\nI am still lacking a way to do this on Linux.\nI tried to get this working with rsync\n($ rsync -arv --delete --delete-missing-args --files-from=&lt;(grep -v '^#' /SOME/PATH/Playlist.m3u) /PATH/TO/MUSIC/ /home/USER/destination/)\nand could achieve that the music got copied to the destination folder. However, files that i randomly copied in the destination folder for testing would not get deleted however i altered the command. Rsync would just ignore the files that i copied there myself.\n\nSo, does anyone have an idea how i could get this working?\nMaybe i could build a script that creates symlinks for each music file in a temp folder that then gets synchronized via rsync or FreeFileSync? Or is there a way to do this with SyncThing?\n\nOne more thing, my favourites-playlist consists of &gt;1500 files, so just nuking all music on my phone and then copying everything takes roughly 60 minutes. Not ideal for just adding a few new songs every few days.\n\nIn an ideal world i would like to have a script that scans my music library for files based on a 5* rating (ratings on Linux are weird...) and would sync them to my phone.\n\nThank you so much for your help!\n",

This is my first time using Btrfs (always been on ext4), so I'd appreciate any feedback on my setup to make sure I'm following best practices.\n\n# My Setup\n\n**Hardware/Disk Layout:**\n\n* **Disk 1 (sda - 60GB):** System disk\n   * sda1: 2GB /boot partition (FAT32)\n   * sda2: 58GB LUKS encrypted partition (cryptlvm)\n* **sda2**:  on LUKS with two logical volumes:\n   * vg1-root: 23.2GB (Btrfs)\n   * vg1-home: 34.8GB (Btrfs)\n* **Disk 2 (sdb - 10GB):** Data disk\n   * LUKS encrypted, no LVM (named cryptlvm2 despite no LVM!)\n   * Single Btrfs filesystem mounted at /mnt/Data\n* **Boot manager:** rEFInd\n\n**Subvolume Layout for LVs:**\n\n    vg1-root (Btrfs):\n      @           -&gt; /\n      @var        -&gt; /var\n      @tmp        -&gt; /tmp\n      @swap       -&gt; /swap (contains swapfile)\n      \n    vg1-home (Btrfs):\n      @home           -&gt; /home\n      @home_snapshots -&gt; /home/.snapshots\n\nI used `snapper` to set up automatic snapshots of the root partition. It created a .snapshot subvolume.\n\n**Current fstab:**\n\n    # vg1-root subvolumes\n    UUID=debbb9c9-0a1e-4ce0-b776-bf9542051a56  /            btrfs  rw,relatime,compress=zstd:3,space_cache=v2,subvol=/@      0 0\n    UUID=debbb9c9-0a1e-4ce0-b776-bf9542051a56  /.snapshots  btrfs  rw,relatime,compress=zstd:3,space_cache=v2,subvolid=5    0 0\n    UUID=debbb9c9-0a1e-4ce0-b776-bf9542051a56  /var         btrfs  rw,relatime,compress=zstd:3,space_cache=v2,subvol=/@var  0 0\n    UUID=debbb9c9-0a1e-4ce0-b776-bf9542051a56  /tmp         btrfs  rw,relatime,compress=zstd:3,space_cache=v2,subvol=/@tmp  0 0\n    UUID=debbb9c9-0a1e-4ce0-b776-bf9542051a56  /swap        btrfs  rw,relatime,compress=zstd:3,space_cache=v2,subvol=/@swap 0 0\n    \n    # vg1-home subvolumes\n    UUID=01c77df7-acc9-496d-a9d5-938ff0e503de  /home            btrfs  rw,relatime,compress=zstd:3,space_cache=v2,subvol=/@home            0 0\n    UUID=01c77df7-acc9-496d-a9d5-938ff0e503de  /home/.snapshots btrfs  rw,relatime,compress=zstd:3,space_cache=v2,subvol=/@home_snapshots  0 0\n    \n    # Other mounts\n    UUID=F0AB-E52E  /boot      vfat   rw,relatime,fmask=0022,dmask=0022,codepage=437,iocharset=ascii,shortname=mixed,utf8,errors=remount-ro  0 2\n    UUID=7274efbe-fbcb-470f-a5c0-ef425c3dd719  /mnt/Data  btrfs  defaults,relatime,compress=zstd,nosuid,nodev,nofail,x-gvfs-show,x-gvfs-name=Data  0 2\n    /swap/swapfile  none  swap  defaults  0 0\n\n`lsblk` output:\n\n    NAME           MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE  MOUNTPOINTS\n    sda              8:0    0   60G  0 disk\n    ├─sda1           8:1    0    2G  0 part  /boot\n    └─sda2           8:2    0   58G  0 part\n      └─cryptlvm   253:0    0   58G  0 crypt\n        ├─vg1-root 253:1    0 23.2G  0 lvm   /.snapshots\n        │                                    /var\n        │                                    /tmp\n        │                                    /swap\n        │                                    /\n        └─vg1-home 253:2    0 34.8G  0 lvm   /home/.snapshots\n                                             /home\n    sdb              8:16   0   10G  0 disk\n    └─cryptlvm2    253:3    0   10G  0 crypt /mnt/Data\n\n# My Questions\n\n1. Do I actually need to mount the .snapshots subvolume?\n2. Is the `subvolid=5` mount for /.snapshots correct? Snapper created the snapshots but didn't auto-generate the fstab entry. I manually added it with `subvolid=5` (mount the top-level Btrfs volume) to allow proper rollbacks without losing snapshot history. Is this the right approach? I tried using `subvol=.snapshots,` `subvol=/@.snapshots,` and `subvol=@.snapshots. However,`they all failed. How should I add the fstab entry properly?\n3. What's the standard subvolume structure? I separated `/var`, `/tmp`, and `/swap` into their own subvolumes to exclude them from root snapshots. Should I also separate `/var/log` and `/var/cache`, or is just `/var` sufficient? What do most people use?\n4. Separate home on different LVM volume - good or bad? I put `/home` on a separate LVM partition for flexibility (The same structure as my current ext4-based system). Does this cause any issues with Btrfs features or snapshots? Is it OK?\n5. Mount options - anything missing? I'm using `compress=zstd:3`, `space_cache=v2`, and `relatime`. Should I add `noatime` or any SSD-specific options like `discard=async`? I have enabled fstrim.service on my system.\n6. Any good blogs/guides for this setup? I've been piecing this together from the Arch Wiki, Claude, and various other sources. Anyone knows a comprehensive guide for Btrfs + Snapper + LVM + LUKS on Arch?\n\n# What Works So Far\n\n* Snapper is creating automatic snapshots successfully.\n* All subvolumes mount correctly on boot.\n* System seems stable.\n* Planning to use refind-btrfs to add snapshot boot entries to rEFInd (though the aur package seems old and unmaintained).\n\nI'd really appreciate any feedback, especially from folks experienced with Btrfs and Snapper. Are there any gotchas I should watch out for or improvements I should make?\n\n**P.S.** The second disk (sdb) automatically unlocks after the first disk using crypttab with a keyfile - pretty convenient for multi-disk LUKS setups!",

I want to hear my phone’s audio on my PC so I can listen to audiobooks while doing stuff on my pc \\[mostly gaming in this case\\]. I need the phone app specifically because I also listen during my long commute, so switching to a separate audiobook player \\[and yes I know cozy and it's nice\\] isn’t an option.\n\nWhat I’m trying to find is basically any way to get my phone’s audio onto my PC wirelessly with low latency whether that’s a proper audio-streaming method, some trick to make wireless ADB actually survive a phone reboot so I don’t have to crawl under my desk every time, or even some PipeWire/ADB/Wi-Fi workaround that isn’t laggy.  \n\n\nI tried scrcpy and it works, but I have to reconnect via USB ADB every time the phone restarts, because my PC’s USB ports are hard to reach. The whole replug USB to re-authenticate ADB step gets annoying fast.\n\nmy network setup: My phone is my hotspot. The hotspot connects to a Wi-Fi repeater. My PC connects to the repeater via ethernet cable.\n\n  \nnote: yes I know changing the listing time manually btween phone and pc is a choice, but I'm lazy and in CS, I will freaking make an app if I had too. I'm too lazy to do the same thingy over and over again and want to automate it if possible I have shell script that kinda does that with wifi debugging but my phone stops using the repeaters' network randomly \\[no internet\\].\n\n  \nsorry if my writing seems like a mess RN it's the ADHD lol.",

The only difference is that I formatted my root partition in BTRFS instead of Ext4.\n\nI followed all the instructions but when it came to setup grub, it told me that modinfo.sh doesn't exist. And when trying another bootloader efibootmgr it told be it couldn't find my EFI partition.\n\nI already tried several times and read all I could find on the subject but I don't get it.\n\nCould you explain to me what does that part with mount and chroot actually does?\n Why did I have to create a directory for /boot and not for /mnt ? I'm sure that the issue comes from that part since it's the part that is still obscure to me...\n\nThank you\n\nEdit: thank you everyone. I understand the command a little better. Still doesn't know why it doesn't work for me but it's just a matter of time before I figure it out...",

    "body": "Virtual sinks (filter-chains) don't restore their saved volume until audio plays. Fixed with a simple systemd service that triggers state restoration at boot.(kind of a hack)\n\nI set up an equalizer using libpipewire-module-filter-chain in PipeWire. It works great, but every time I reboot, the volume resets to 100% instead of what I had before.\nIf I adjust the volume before any audio plays with my wpctl -2% keybind, it takes the 100% state and sets it to 98%. If I play any  audio before executing a wpctl set-volume command, the correct volume loads.\n\nAfter digging through WirePlumber's state files, I found that:\n\nWirePlumber does save virtual sink volumes in ~/.local/state/wireplumber/stream-properties.\nBut it only restores them when a stream connects to the sink\nUntil then, the sink shows 100% volume (uninitialized state)\nAny volume adjustments before the first audio stream overwrites your saved state.\n\nThis is because WirePlumber treats filter-chain sinks like application streams (which activate on-demand) rather than like physical devices (which restore state immediately). It also does not restore mute state for some reason and starts unmuted.\n\nThe Solutions\n\nOption 1: node.always-process = true\nAdded to filter-chain.conf capture.props:\n\n    node.always-process = true\n\nSimple but I found it uses CPU processing silence.\n\nOption 2: \n\nSystemd service: \n\nCreate ~/.config/systemd/user/pipewire-sink-init.service:\n    \n    [Unit]\n    Description=Initialize virtual sink volume\n    After=wireplumber.service\n\n    [Service]\n    Type=oneshot\n    ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 2\n    ExecStart=/bin/sh -c 'pw-link internal_speaker:monitor_FL internal_speaker:playback_FL; pw-link internal_speaker:monitor_FR internal_speaker:playback_FR; sleep 0.1; pw-link -d internal_speaker:monitor_FL internal_speaker:playback_FL; pw-link -d internal_speaker:monitor_FR internal_speaker:playback_FR || true'\n\n    [Install]\n    WantedBy=default.target\n    \n\nWith this I manually create the links (which is what probably happens when a client connects) and destroy them so it can idle correctly.\n\nDo you think I should report this issue upstream? System-wide EQ is a necessity for me because the default tuning of the speaker causes excessive clipping above 50% volume, my EQ makes it very closely match the output of Windows. \n\nSystem Info:\n\nPipewire version: 1.4.9\n\nWireplumber version 0.5.12",

The system was barely usable.\n\nBoth monitors theoretically had the same refresh rate, but whilst my old monitor was **165Hz**, the new one was **164.96Hz**. It was my understanding that this didn't matter, and it was just something to do with the way it was calculated, but it seemed obvious to me that the system considered the monitors to have different refresh rates, which is why it had this stuttering, and nothing I tried helped.\n\nI messed around in nvidia-settings for ages based on what I found when searching for similar issues, but nothing made any difference.\n\nI read that Wayland supported monitors with different refresh rates, so I switched from X11 to Wayland, and it became extremely smooth. It was perfect, and the UFO test looked amazing.\n\nSo my question is: is it possible that a 0.04Hz difference in refresh rate is considered to be different refresh rates? Is it actually different? And is there any way for me to use X11 now or will I be Wayland-only from now on?",

    "body": "TLDR:  \nProblem: Cannot mount ext4 root partition to /mnt  \nSolution: Instead of ext4, format the root partition to btrfs with `mkfs.btrfs`\n\nHi, I'm fairly new to Arch. I had weeks worth of experience with another arch-based distro, though I think I still know very little about arch itself.\n\nAs the title suggests, I'm doing a manual installation of arch. I'm following the wiki, and currently in the *1.11. Mount File Systems* step. I have already created the partitions using cfdisk, none of them returned an error. However, when trying to mount my root partition\n\n`# mount /dev/sdb3 mnt`\n\nI get the following error:\n\n    EXT4-fs (sdb3): Could not load journal inode\n    mount: /mnt: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb3, missing codepage or helper program, or other error. dmesg(1) may have more information after failed mount system call\n\nI tried running `dmesg` , which I'm not familiar with, and got a bunch off lines that seem to be the system's logs for my session of installation. At the end, there are a few repeating entries saying:\n\n    Alternate GPT is invalid, using primary GPT\n    sdb: sdb1 sdb2 sdb3\n    JBD2: no valid journal superblock found\n    EXT4-fs (sdb3): Could not load journal inode\n\nAnd those last two lines with JBD2 and EXT4-fs are printed 7x more.\n\nI tried mounting my EFI partition to /mnt/boot, which was a success. Now I don't know why my ext4 root partition is not mounting, returning the errors I've mentioned above.\n\nIf I missed something please let me know. If you need some more info, lmk. Thank you in advance :)\n\n**UPDATE**: I tried formatting the partition into an ext3 filesystem instead of ext4. Then, I mounted it and... it worked? Though it returned this error:\n\n    EXT4-fs error (device sdb3): ext4_mb_generate_buddy:1212: group XXX, block bitmap and bg descriptor inconsistent: 0 vs 32255 free clusters\n\nAnd it's not just one line of that error. It returned a bunch, I think 5. \"group XXX\" also has XXX as different numbers for every iteration of this error.\n\nAfter this, I ran lsblk -f and found that the root partition, /sdb3 is now mounted. Though I'm afraid this could lead to potential issues down the road if I just ignore the error I just mentioned... so I'm still open for insights. Thank you.\n\n**UPDATE:** Okay, I think I fixed it. Some of you suggested to use btrfs instead of ext4 for my root partition, which I did. It actually worked wow! I'm not in the pacstrap installation, and I hope it'll go smooth sailing from here.\n\nI learned a lot. Thank you so much!\n\nPS: If y'all like to suggest something, I'd be open for anything. Or if formatting my root partition isa  bad idea, please do tell me why :))",

Note: ive got three notebooks where i want to install Keepass - instances.\n\nAnd that said: i want to store the \\`.kdbx\\` file from Keepass on GDrive - i have no other Option. OR do you have some recommendations!?\n\nsome **assumptions**: I guess that it is encrypted in the keepass-installation on my device just before it even lands in Google Drive.  \nSo i guess that this file will be on Google Drive encrypted — completely  :grinning\\_face:\n\n...subsequently the content can only be decrypted with my so alled:\n\n**Master password**\n\n* optional Keyfile, and AES-256 encryption\n\n...that means that Google CANNOT see the passwords. They only see \"an encrypted file\".\n\nThs is good for the security-Level\n\nThe password database is then (consequently) protected by:\n\n* AES-256 or ChaCha20 (depending on the setting) Key Derivation Function (Argon2 or AES-KDF) Key transformation rounds Option: additionally \\*\\*Keyfile for 2-factor encryption\n\nthat makes me lucky - cause: even if someone steals the file from Google Drive:\n\nnow the **question**: whats your recommendation for the setup: i want to use MX-Linux, then what is the best solution to connect to Google Drive!?\n\n**whats your recommendation** No. 1 here which tool, would you go to use?:\n\nshould i use → Rclone + systemd mount (stable, secure, 100% controllable)\\*\\*\n\nsome of my friends told me that i should go with Rclone: They are convinces by **Rclone** since it\n\n\\* Works perfectly on most Linux  \n\\* Extremely reliable  \n\\* Very actively maintained  \n\\* Encryption \\*optional\\* possible\n\nThe **question is**: Can i use it with LXQT too - or do i have to use KDE (or such things!?)\n\ni look forward to hear from you\n\nregards ",

    "title": "About the wrong resolution problems with NVIDIA 580.105.08-3, should I just wait for an update that fixes that? Or how I can downgrade the package?",
    "body": "After NVIDIA was updated to version 580.105.08-3 the system no longer detects some resolutions on some monitors. For example, I have an ultra wide monitor (2560×1080) but after the update it only detects up to 1920x1080. I'm using KDE and Wayland.\n\nI searched on the forum and they recommend to downgrade the package: [https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=310035&amp;p=2](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=310035&amp;p=2)\n\nAnd apparently [NVIDIA is working on a fix.](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/580-release-feedback-discussion/341205/795)\n\nSo I tried to downgrade the packages with a \n\n    sudo pacman -U nvidia-580.95.05-9-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst nvidia-settings-580.95.05-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst nvidia-utils-580.95.05-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst lib32-nvidia-utils-580.95.05-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst nvidia-lts-1:580.95.05-7-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst\n\nbut after that mkinitcpio fails because it can't find the modules for NVIDIA, I think it might be because the kernel was also updated (6.17.7.arch1-1 -&gt; 6.17.8.arch1-1), so the old 580.95.05-9 modules won't work with the new kernel. I don't know if I would need to compile the old drivers for them to work. \n\nBut at this point I thought, well, this wrong resolution is annoying but not that bad, this PC is not my daily driver, right now I'm very sick and I should rest instead of dealing with this, so I was thinking to just wait for an upgrade that fixes this. Some day. Hopefully.",

I’m sharing my solution to hopefully make the process clearer for others who run into the same issue.\n\n⚠️Disclaimer⚠️ This setup was tested on my HP Envy (model: 13-ba0010nr) with a Realtek ALC245 codec on Arch Linux (PulseAudio). Other HP models or audio backends (PipeWire, etc.) may require small adjustments. I can only guarentee function if you have these exact specifications  \nEven if you have a different model, I'm hoping this guide will at least help push you in the right direction. If you have a different model and this does work, please let me know!\n\n# Required Dependencies\n\nIf using pipewire: pipewire-pulse\n\n    sudo pacman -S pipewire pipewire-pulse wireplumber\n\nawk (usually preinstalled but try it just to be safe)\n\n    sudo pacman -S gawk\n\nalsa-tools\n\n    sudo pacman -S alsa-toolsalsa-toolssudo pacman -S alsa-tools\n\nalsa-utils\n\n    sudo pacman -S alsa-utils\n\n# Audio (Speaker) LED Setup:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Codec Device**\n\nRun this command in a terminal:\n\n    grep \"Speaker Playback Volume\" /proc/asound/card*/codec*\n\nYou’ll get output similar to:\n\n    /proc/asound/card0/codec#0: Control: name=\"Speaker Playback Volume\", index=0, device=0\n\nThis means your codec device is **hwC0D0**.  \nYours might differ (usually **hwC0D0**, **hwC1D0**, or **hwC2D0**). If it does, you will need to correct both .sh files to your corresponding codec device. \n\n**Step 2: Create a Script Directory**\n\nRun this command in a terminal:\n\n    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin/\n\n**Step 3: Create the Audio Mute LED Script**\n\nRun this command in a terminal:\n\n* You can name your file whatever you want.

    "body": "Hi, I want to get rid of grub and boot my system directly to Arch Linux. I browsed the wiki and found the article on both tools.\n\nI just wanted to double check with more experienced users if I follow these steps everything will be fine after I reboot (this was compiled by Gemini after it \"searched\" the information on web, including the Arch Linux wiki):\n\n---\n\n### 1. Create the EFI boot entry\n\n* **Find your kernel and initramfs:** Identify the location of your kernel (e.g., `/boot/vmlinuz-linux`) and your initramfs (e.g., `/boot/initramfs-linux.img`).\n* **Use `efibootmgr` to create the entry:**\n    * To create a new entry, use the following command, replacing paths and parameters as needed:\n\n            sudo efibootmgr --create --disk /dev/sdX --part Y --loader /vmlinuz-linux --label \"Arch Linux\" --verbose --unicode \"root=UUID=YOUR_ROOT_UUID rw initrd=\\initramfs-linux.img\"\n\n    * **Explanation of flags:**\n        * `--disk /dev/sdX --part Y`: Specifies your ESP (e.g., `/dev/sda` and partition `1`).\n        * `--loader /vmlinuz-linux`: Points to your kernel.\n        * `--label \"Arch Linux\"`: Sets the name for the boot entry.\n        * `--verbose`: Provides more output.\n        * `--unicode \"root=UUID=YOUR_ROOT_UUID rw initrd=\\initramfs-linux.img\"`: Sets the kernel parameters. You will need to replace **YOUR\\_ROOT\\_UUID** with your actual root partition's UUID.\n\n*(Note: The user's original text included a \"Save the boot entry\" step, which is redundant as the `--create` command already saves it. I've removed it to avoid confusion.)*\n\n### 2. Remove GRUB\n\n* **Uninstall GRUB:** Once you have verified that you can boot into Arch with the new EFI entry, uninstall GRUB:\n\n        sudo pacman -Rns grub\n\n* **Delete GRUB files:** Remove the GRUB installation directory:\n\n        sudo rm -rf /boot/grub\n\n* **Delete the GRUB boot entry:** Remove the old GRUB entry from the EFI boot manager:\n    * Use `efibootmgr` to find the old GRUB entry number (e.g., `0001`).\n    * Delete it (replacing `0001` with the correct number):\n\n            sudo efibootmgr --bootnum 0001 --delete-bootnum\n\n### 3. Configure the boot order\n\n* **Set your new entry as default:**\n    * Check the output of `efibootmgr` to see the new boot entry's number (e.g., `0002`).\n    * Run `efibootmgr --bootorder XXXX,YYYY` to set your new entry (**XXXX**) as the first to boot, followed by any other entries you want to keep (`YYYY`).\n",

While enabling on-access scanning makes a lot of sense for protecting against real-time threats, this eats up a lot of memory and does not seem scalable across multiple VMs. Setting up a cronjob to scan the system (or just files that are likely to get accessed) seems the more resource conscientious approach. Is the reasonable way to do this to choose between these options depending on what the server is setup to do? i.e. if it were an internet-facing web server to have on-access scanning setup, but if it were just a local Plex server to just do ad hoc or scheduled scanning?\n\nAdditionally, I'm unclear on the differences between clamd and the on access scan daemon. Do I need to always have clamd running even if I just want to do ad hoc/scheduled scans but not on-access scanning? Does clamd similarly keep all virus signatures loaded into memory all the time?",

    "body": "Goal: Install Arch using Btrfs using GRUB2 bootloader and LUKS2 Argon2 encryption on root and /boot.   Setup Snapper for snapshots.\n\nBackground: I was partially following this guide [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiK1cGbyaxs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiK1cGbyaxs) to setup Snapper for snapshots, but the guide doesn't use LUKS2 and that's where I'm running into trouble. I saw that GRUB2 doesn't support LUKS2 using Argon2, but found [https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/grub-improved-luks2-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/grub-improved-luks2-git) that patches it. However I keep running into issues when trying to patch grub whether using 'yay' and 'git clone &amp; makepkg -si'. The farthest I've ever gotten was I think the patch went through and GRUB2 will let me decrypt the drive but it fails to find the UUID to boot into Arch itself. I've exhausted my Googling and Chat AI abilities. Adding the UUID to config file and rebuilding GRUB didn't help.\n\nI'm currently testing this on Win 11 Pro with Hyper V if that makes any difference.\n\nI started over and this screenshot is the error I get when trying to patch GRUB2: [https://imgur.com/a/i9qxqEn](https://imgur.com/a/i9qxqEn)\n\nUPDATE: Decided to try it again from a new VM build and everything worked without having to patch GRUB. I was previously using a checkpoint save which probably didn't include the latest version of GRUB. Thanks all.",

    "title": "Sway help: How to assign workspaces to monitors?",
    "body": "Firstly, I hope it is okay for me to post this here - I'd post this in the SwayWM subreddit but I requested access almost a week ago and haven't heard anything back.\n\nI'm trying to configure a 3-monitor setup that can transition to a single monitor (laptop). I've gotten pretty much everything working but I cannot get the workspaces to cooperate. \n\nHere's the script that I have run at startup and when I refresh the config:\n```lua\n#!/usr/bin/env lua\n\nlocal function contains(table, value)\n\tfor i, val in ipairs(table) do\n\t\tif val == value then\n\t\t\treturn true\n\t\tend\n\tend\n\treturn false\nend\n\nhandle = io.popen('echo \"$(swaymsg -t get_outputs -r)\" | jq -r \".[] | .name\"')\n\nif not handle then\n\terror('Unable to execute command')\nend\n\nmonitors = {}\nfor line in handle:lines() do\n\ttable.insert(monitors, line)\nend\nhandle:close()\n\nfor i,mon in ipairs(monitors) do\n\tprint(mon)\nend\nif contains(monitors, \"DP-3\") and\n   contains(monitors, \"DP-1\") and\n   contains(monitors, \"eDP-1\") then\n\tprint('Outputs found...')\n\tos.execute('swaymsg output eDP-1 pos 1920 100 scale 1.5 res 1920x1080')\n\tos.execute('swaymsg output DP-1  pos 1920 100 scale 1.5 res 1920x1080')\n\tos.execute('swaymsg output DP-3  pos    0   0 scale 1   res 1920x1080')\n\tos.execute('sed -i \\'s/eDP-1/DP-3/g\\' ~/.config/waybar/config.jsonc')\nelseif contains(monitors, \"DP-3\") and\n       contains(monitors, \"eDP-1\") then\n\tprint('Projector not found, setting up for two monitors...')\n\tos.execute('swaymsg output eDP-1 pos 1920 100 scale 1.5 res 1920x1080')\n\tos.execute('swaymsg output DP-3  pos    0   0 scale 1   res 1920x1080')\n\tos.execute('sed -i \\'s/eDP-1/DP-3/g\\' ~/.config/waybar/config.jsonc')\nelse\n\tprint('Outputs NOT found...')\n\tos.execute('swaymsg output eDP-1 pos 0 0 scale 1.25 res 1920x1200')\n\tos.execute('sed -i \\'s/DP-3/eDP-1/g\\' ~/.config/waybar/config.jsonc')\nend\n```\n\nI've tried including `os.execute('swaymsg workspace 1 output DP-3')` etc for all 9 workspaces after setting up the outputs but it always just seems to assign them randomly. Any idea how I can get it to assign the workspaces correctly?\n\nEDIT: In digging through the documentation a bit more, I came across this:\n\n&gt; workspace &lt;name&gt; output &lt;outputs...&gt;\n\n&gt; Specifies that workspace name should be shown on the specified outputs. Multiple outputs can be listed and the first available will be used. If the workspace gets placed on an output further down the list and an output that is higher on the list becomes available, the workspace will be moved to the higher priority output.\nThis command does not affect existing workspaces. To move an existing workspace, use the move command in combination with the workspace criteria (non-empty workspaces only) or workspace command (to switch to the workspace before moving).\n\n&gt; [https://man.archlinux.org/man/sway.5.en](https://man.archlinux.org/man/sway.5.en)\n\nSo if I'm reading this correctly, it sounds like I could define all of the workspaces in the sway config file, including the fallback monitor in the same line. For example in `~/.config/sway/config`:\n```\nworkspace 1 output DP-3 eDP-1\nworkspace 2 output eDP-1\nworkspace 3 output DP-1 eDP-1\nworkspace 4 output DP-3 eDP-1\n``` \netc.\n\nIf I'm understanding correctly, this will assign them when the config is reloaded and they don't already exist. I'll try this tomorrow.\n\nEDIT2: It worked! Yay!",

This makes me think something changed with the `nvme` module or its dependencies in the newer kernel.\n\nDid the `nvme` module get split, or does it now require another specific module (like `nvme_core` or maybe `vmd`?) to be explicitly loaded in the `MODULES` array?\n\nHas anyone else with a minimal `HOOKS=(base)` config run into this?

    "body": "I don't think it is a mouse issue per se, but upon installing more than 1 DE on fresh install of Arch, I have at least one DE exhibiting this strange \"mouse drag\" behavior, where I move a mouse a lot, but it moves in microsteps\n\nLast time it happened when I installed XFCE on top of Cinnamon Arch. Xfce was rendered usuable with same issue\n\nI have reinstalled Arch around 5 times experimenting with DEs and if I install more than 1, another instance flat out breaks just like here.\n\nThis time it is 2nd DE that is freaking out\nAs a side note, when I played a game (when it was working on this DE), mouse was very slow, but I could move the mouse fine on desktop\n\nUpon restarting to see if game issue was solved, I was met oncw again with this strange behavior\n\nBut it seems to be affecting not just a mouse. Whole DE seems to be malfunctioning\n\nI am installing additional DEs based on directions. \n\nCan someone explain this issue? \nThis is a 5th time reinstalling Arch and there is at least one DE that breaks in exact same way\n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/scyCRLdSeNA?si=MW9kX_-3j-K3NpTC\n\n\nSide note: This usually happens with 2nd DE I install, 1st one (native) remains fine, and following DEs (after 2nd one) can be fine. I don't understand the reason, because it's not tied to a specific DE, it can be anything that I picked for a 2nd install. The following ones for some reason are fine too. \n\nAlso, removing lxde and lxdm, then reinstalling does not solve the issue. Previously (on one of my Arch installs), I had xfce installed as a second DE, and removing it and reinstalling it did not solve this issue either.\n\nIt's like 2nd DE is perpetually bugged, and I don't get it, do I need to install 3 of them, and then remove 1 to bypass that issue? It's so strange",

    "body": "I have arch install on a Dell Latitude 5591, version with integrated graphics only (intel 630)\n\nSystem worked fine in the past, but was not updated for maybe a year and a half. Recently I did a full update, after which system started to freeze completely pretty quickly after boot.  \nIt seems like it gets semi-unresponsive before reaching hard freeze state. For example, you can type some commands in terminal (like vim), and wait forever, sometimes you can Ctrl-C out of it, but in like 20 seconds or so after being semi-unresponsive system will reach a hard freeze state: no longer responding to any input, doesn't answer pings, etc; only hard power reset helps. Sometimes it happens quite fast so you don't have time to even login, sometimes a bit later.\n\nI booted an old arch iso that I had nearby (archlinux-2023.06.01-x86\\_64.iso) to try and run some diagnostics, to no avail.  \nThen I wanted to to update BIOS with fwupdmgr, but couldn't do it with old iso without updating (or I thought so), so I burned the newest one (archlinux-2025.11.01-x86\\_64.iso).  \nAnd now I have the same hard freeze problem with arch iso as I have with my own system, it also makes the system hard freeze very quickly after boot.  \nSomewhat of a relief, but not quite. Then I read somewhere that using \"nomodeset\" kernel parameter can help circumvent the problem, and it does, no freezes happen when loading my system with nomodeset, but it doesn't seem like a quality solution.\n\nAlso tried to downgrade to lts kernel (6.12.57-1), to no avail.\n\nmemcheck said ok.\n\njournalctl -b -1: [https://pastebin.com/84vbN7dq](https://pastebin.com/84vbN7dq)",

I was about to upgrade my PC anyway so why not experiment? In a call with my friends I said that I’m done with the Microsoft crap and I left the call and immediately went to install arch. And post install it was just as good as I thought it would be, I started with KDE, downloaded all my stuff, transferred files and it all worked perfectly. Then for like a month I dug through the rabbit hole and tried hyprland, then went back to kde, tried dual booting. And yes sometimes the troubleshooting can be annoying but once I got to know my way around the terminal it all worked out perfectly. I can now proudly call myself an arch user!

    "title": "2 years in and I finally feel somewhat knowledgable",
    "body": "So I had to nuke some harddrives (dealing with someone who got access to my google accounts, and potentially my computer(s), so had to go scorched earth on my setup.  Was painfully necessary unfortunately) and I had gotten more than a little lazy when it comes to security.  So when I started rebuilding my setup I installed Arch onto an encrypted thumbdrive and used BTRFS (BTRFS isn't the fastest solution for an operating system on a USB thumbdrive by the way) with separate subvolumes for the logs, var, home, and root folders.  This made for a great setup for snapshots, but I really wasn't considering the implications for when I eventually migrated from a thumbdrive to an SSD.\n\n  \nCut to a few days ago, I finally decide to buy a new NVME SSD for my laptop (I wasn't the only person hacked, and the authorities have been involved, so I'm fairly sure that this person won't be making any further moves moving forward, if I had to guess) and legitimize my Arch install.  I also wanted to get more space and speed things up--even with a barebones Arch install using Hyprland, the speed for random reads and writes is pretty abysmal, and I am usually doing development on my PC's these days.\n\n  \nSo I go to migrate my install and realize...this is a bit more complicated than a simple 'rsync -aHAXS /mnt/source /mnt/target'.  Having to recreate the filesystem, setup the encryption, copy all of the subvolumes, ensure that everything interacts with everything else correctly is a bit, well, intense, all things considered.\n\nHowever, after a day or so of transferring (good god usb thumbdrive's are slow.  Less than 1 million files and 220GB took literally 24 hours to fully copy) and a couple hours of setup, I unplugged my thumbdrive on reboot, sure I'd absolutely fucked up SOMETHING along the way but...\n\n  \nShe boots.  No problems, no missing anything, no hitches, everything in place.  Even my browser history and tmux settings are in tact.  Literally everything is there and everything works.  For the first time since I switched to Linux 2 years ago, I've successfully completed a somewhat complicated operation, with zero problems, zero issues, and zero caveats.\n\nI know in the grand scheme of things, this is somewhat minor.  But I just feel like I finally achieved some base level of competency in Linux that I'd spent decades at in Windows.  I did my first data migration when I was 12 years old in Windows, and while it's a bit simpler in an unencrypted Windows 98 installation than it is in pretty much any Arch Linux installation, still.  Just feels good.\n\n  \nAnyways, that's all I got.  Silly?  Sure.  But my foray into learning Linux started with Ubuntu (ugh) and, even though Arch is better, it's MUCH more intricate for doing things that matter.  I've only recently started using regex regularly, I picked up neovim finally a few months ago, and it took me almost a year to even try tmux.  Normally it wouldn't take this long, but the whole reason I began learning Linux was because I was getting into machine learning and trying to figure out how to utilize, make, and dissect LLMs and see what makes them tick--so it was buy a used Mac or install Linux.  Linux is/was the 'free' option, so that became my go-to.  I dual booted for a year, and only recently decided to go Arch only.  I finally feel comfortable editing config service files, and the only time I refer to documentation is when trying out new software.  I've learned how to use cmake/ninja/bazel/git (although I'm still somewhat novice with these, I can use them functionally), and I even branched out from Python to relearn some C++ and mess around with Zig.\n\n  \nI'm far from a guru, but I do like being competent, at the very least.  I need to learn more about the base programs/services that (most) Linux distributions ship with (like sed, grep, and others--I still just use grep for 'grep -r \"\\[search query\\] .\" and the like, ,or 'ps aux | grep' or 'lsmod | grep' etc etc; basic stuff), but I at least have a grasp on all of the different things that CAN be done.  From there it's just a quick --help or google search to figure out how to do what I want to do.\n\n  \nI dunno, it's just nice to have done all this myself, put the onus on myself to learn everything I have (I have had no job, school, or other outside influence on me to pick any of this up--in fact, I spent 90% of my free time playing competitive video games before all of this, so learning to program and to use Linux was more than a bit of a left turn all things considered), and it's beginning to pay off in some really rewarding ways.\n\n  \nP.S. setting up a tmux/bash script to display CPU/GPU/RAM/VRAM/DISK utilization in my status bar has been probably my favorite part of it all.  Customizing tmux is super fun, and keeping my eye on all of that hardware information keeps me from having to have htop/btop open in an adjacent pane while running various programs.\n\n  \nThanks for reading my blog /s",

    "body": "I was wondering how to deal with a hostile maintainer who is squatting on a set of packages, but refuses to update them in a timely manner or to make improvements / fixes to the packages.\n\nThe packages in question are wlcs, mir, and miracle-wm. I have been the one to update the packages this year, after a previous conflict where the current maintainer added me as a co-maintainer. They only did so when I opened an orphaned request after weeks of not updating the package, with zero communication.\n\nThis person doesn't communicate, doesn't make sense when they are forced to, and acts down right hostile. I don't think they even use the packages, rather is interested in collecting AUR packages like they are pokemon, as they currently post on github \"maintainer of 450+ AUR packages\". They actually swooped in to claim the mir package after I sent in an orphan request so I could adopt it.",

    "body": "I know this is technically not really a question about arch linux but I know at least people in this sub will have experience with dual booting.\n\nI just built a new PC with an ASUS motherboard to replace my laptop with an MSI motherboard. I moved over my arch linux drive intact and reinstalled windows since I didn’t trust it to continue functioning properly on a new machine with totally different hardware.\n\nFor some reason, windows decided to install its boot loader into my linux EFI partition. This would have been fine except for the fact that it made it so that on every windows boot, it would completely delete GRUB from\nmy NVRAM. Every single time. I ended up moving all of the linux boot files to another EFI partition so it would stop doing that.\n\nOnly issue is that now instead of deleting GRUB from my boot options on every boot, it just makes itself the first boot option, meaning that every time I boot into windows any subsequent boot will also boot into windows instead of grub. This is actual malware-type behavior, and I have no idea how to make it stop doing this. Anybody else have this happen?\n\nEDIT: I fixed it by moving the EFI partition off of my linux drive, which was on a SATA SSD, to the end of my storage drive, which is an nvme SSD. The moment I did that and reinstalled grub to make sure it booted right windows stopped messing with my boot order. I do not know why windows specifically doesn’t like that it’s lower in boot priority to a sata drive but i guess it’s fine now.",

This is useful after a large file copy. Disk write cache and swap both stay full and the system actually slows down. i don't know why Linux doesn't automatically release this memory after a large file copy is complete. But it doesn't for whatever reason. This set of commands dumps the cache and reclaims that memory. It gives the computer a bit of a boost. It's quite noticeable on lower end hardware.\n\nTrim: trims all volumes.\n\nupdate: updates repo packages and aur packages, the default behavior for paccache is to keep the last three packages in cache and clear the rest. I do this to save disk space. I can always roll back beyond that with the downgrade tool if need be. Updates snap and flatpaks. I don't' have any snaps installed. But i have that in the command just in case i ever do.\n\nInstall / remove: pretty obvious what those do.\n\nfind: searches the repo and aur for packages.\n\nbuild: tells it to build an AUR package\n\nClean: displays orphaned packages from both pacman and yay and prompts you to remove them.\n\nOrphans: only list the orphans, does not remove them.\n\nRank: uses reflector to search for and rank mirrors. \n\nAnyways. that's what i got.

Installed fl studio and now need a way to access my sounds within the VM without giving windows access to the home folder :D\n\n\n\n\n\nI've decided to switch to arch linux. As a complete beginner I understand that this is a risky move, but I desire to learn and grow through this journey.\n\nI had to leave behind windows because i couldn't make a partition big enough for my linux endeavor, so I decided to just install arch on the whole drive: I used archinstall, encrypted the ssd and I'm using the hardened linux kernel bc I'd like to bring some privacy and digital security back into my life (i did install and activate a firewall too).\n\nNow, I bought and I've been using Fl Studio for quite some time and after looking at a couple of wine tutorials, specific for this topic, I thought I could get it working. I did get it to work somewhat, but got quite a few errors and unfortunately don't have an audio interface compatible with linux.\n\nMy 2 main questions are:\n\n1. Is it possible to get it working, perhaps using a solution like \"bottles\" and routing my audio properly using carla (or something a bit more intuitive) in a way that works?\n2. would it be a viable option to dualboot windows on the same encrypted ssd without having to start over from scratch (which I wouldn't mind too much)?\n\nI'll provide some extra information if needed and any help would be highly appreciated...\n\nSome extra info I feel might be useful for you to know: running kde plasma 6, i set up timeshift on this partition using RSYNC, BTRFC file structure...\n\nI set it all up today so I will take all recommendations into consideration and I'm willing to start fresh and vanilla arch is not a must as long as I'm able to customize everything and make music :)\n\nThank you so unbelievably much in advance and whether you help me or are just passing by, thank you for existing!",

I need the phone app specifically because I also listen during my long commute, so switching to a separate audiobook player \\[and yes I know cozy and it's nice\\] isn’t an option.\n\nWhat I’m trying to find is basically any way to get my phone’s audio onto my PC wirelessly with low latency whether that’s a proper audio-streaming method, some trick to make wireless ADB actually survive a phone reboot so I don’t have to crawl under my desk every time, or even some PipeWire/ADB/Wi-Fi workaround that isn’t laggy.  \n\n\nI tried scrcpy and it works, but I have to reconnect via USB ADB every time the phone restarts, because my PC’s USB ports are hard to reach. The whole replug USB to re-authenticate ADB step gets annoying fast.\n\nmy network setup: My phone is my hotspot. The hotspot connects to a Wi-Fi repeater. My PC connects to the repeater via ethernet cable.\n\n  \nnote: yes I know changing the listing time manually btween phone and pc is a choice, but I'm lazy and in CS, I will freaking make an app if I had too.

For example, I have an ultra wide monitor (2560×1080) but after the update it only detects up to 1920x1080. I'm using KDE and Wayland.\n\nI searched on the forum and they recommend to downgrade the package: [https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=310035&amp;p=2](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=310035&amp;p=2)\n\nAnd apparently [NVIDIA is working on a fix.](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/580-release-feedback-discussion/341205/795)\n\nSo I tried to downgrade the packages with a \n\n    sudo pacman -U nvidia-580.95.05-9-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst nvidia-settings-580.95.05-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst nvidia-utils-580.95.05-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst lib32-nvidia-utils-580.95.05-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst nvidia-lts-1:580.95.05-7-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst\n\nbut after that mkinitcpio fails because it can't find the modules for NVIDIA, I think it might be because the kernel was also updated (6.17.7.arch1-1 -&gt; 6.17.8.arch1-1), so the old 580.95.05-9 modules won't work with the new kernel. I don't know if I would need to compile the old drivers for them to work. \n\nBut at this point I thought, well, this wrong resolution is annoying but not that bad, this PC is not my daily driver, right now I'm very sick and I should rest instead of dealing with this, so I was thinking to just wait for an upgrade that fixes this.

I just ran into my first ever Kernel panic today and it seems to be tied to hibernation. I first encountered this issue when I let the battery drain to 0 for the first time and just as the system was about to enter hibernation I encountered a Kernel panic with a \"fatal exception in interrupt\" message and no information in the panic report except for the arch version. Manually triggering hibernate using systemctl hibernate seems to trigger this same issue every single time, so I am quite sure that's the reason. Journalctl also only shows the system entering hibernation after shutting down the main cpu threads and nothing after that. Any help on this is appreciated; I also wasn't really able to find how to change the normal empty battery handling routine so the system just shuts down instead of hibernating so some guidance on that would be appreciated while I am dealing with this issue.",

    "body": "I don't think it is a mouse issue per se, but upon installing more than 1 DE on fresh install of Arch, I have at least one DE exhibiting this strange \"mouse drag\" behavior, where I move a mouse a lot, but it moves in microsteps\n\nLast time it happened when I installed XFCE on top of Cinnamon Arch. Xfce was rendered usuable with same issue\n\nI have reinstalled Arch around 5 times experimenting with DEs and if I install more than 1, another instance flat out breaks just like here.\n\nThis time it is 2nd DE that is freaking out\nAs a side note, when I played a game (when it was working on this DE), mouse was very slow, but I could move the mouse fine on desktop\n\nUpon restarting to see if game issue was solved, I was met oncw again with this strange behavior\n\nBut it seems to be affecting not just a mouse. Whole DE seems to be malfunctioning\n\nI am installing additional DEs based on directions. \n\nCan someone explain this issue? \nThis is a 5th time reinstalling Arch and there is at least one DE that breaks in exact same way\n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/scyCRLdSeNA?si=MW9kX_-3j-K3NpTC\n\n\nSide note: This usually happens with 2nd DE I install, 1st one (native) remains fine, and following DEs (after 2nd one) can be fine. I don't understand the reason, because it's not tied to a specific DE, it can be anything that I picked for a 2nd install. The following ones for some reason are fine too. \n\nAlso, removing lxde and lxdm, then reinstalling does not solve the issue. Previously (on one of my Arch installs), I had xfce installed as a second DE, and removing it and reinstalling it did not solve this issue either.\n\nIt's like 2nd DE is perpetually bugged, and I don't get it, do I need to install 3 of them, and then remove 1 to bypass that issue? It's so strange",

The problem is with the login screen.\n\nWhenever I log in(after login), the whole screen goes black for a noticeable amount of time, around 2 seconds, before hyprland shows up. The same thing happens with hyprlock; when I unlock, there’s a brief black screen. Also, I’m not really sure what SDDM is for. I’ve heard that hyprlock can only be used after the screen has already been unlocked, not as the initial lock screen. So I’m using SDDM as the initial lock screen, but I’m not sure if that’s proper arch way. \n\nSo, how do I fix this black screen and completely remove KDE? Also, if there’s a more Arch-native way to display the initial GUI lock screen, I’d like to know.\n\nAlso, if there is no window in the current workspace and I open the terminal, I want that window to open at a size of 320×520, positioned exactly at the center of the screen. If a follow-up window is created, it should inherit and follow the original layout. How can I do this?",

    "body": "Hi everyone,    \nI recently installed Arch Linux with Hyprland, but after GRUB the system pauses around 15 seconds on the “Loading initial ramdisk” message before continuing to boot.  \n  \nMy hardware includes:    \n\\- Ryzen 7 5800X    \n\\- 32 GB RAM    \n\\- NVIDIA RTX 3060    \n\\- Fast NVMe SSD    \n\\- BTRFS filesystem    \n  \nI’ve been using Linux only for a few months, so I’m not an expert. I tried changing the initramfs compression from zstd to lz4—something I read online as a possible fix—but it didn’t help.  \n  \nInterestingly, I also have Arch with XFCE installed on a notebook with a Celeron processor and an ext4 filesystem, and that boots almost instantly.  \n  \nDoes anyone know what might be causing this delay? Thanks in advance for any suggestions!",

Yup. Nvidia and Wayland. \n\nNo problems so far, even hibernation works. \n\nMaybe it's a matter of _when_, not _if_ it breaks?\n\nWhat has your experience with nvidia hardware been like? ",

point when something is done with the NVMEs in my PC. I can't really figure out what the problem might be. That both NVMEs are being affected lets me think there might be a motherboard failure? It would surprise me though, because i just build my system with brand new parts about a month ago and it otherwise runs completely fine.\n\nI am very willing to investigate further on my own, but right now i have no clue as to where to start or rather in what direction.\n\nThanks a lot for any help!",

~~I hope that long link pasted in properly~~\n\nThe /etc/fstab file looks fine.\n\nLooking into the pacman log, it looks like the boot partition is full...  \nIt's 350MiB and 349.27MiB are used.. how do i free up space or enlarge the partition when i cant boot into it? Can i just shrink the root partition and expand the boot partition with gparted or something through a live-USB? Oh, or can i shrink the SWAP partition for it? partition table is\n\n1. boot - fat32 - 350 MiB\n2. SWAP - linuxswap - 8 GiB\n3. arch\\_os - ext4 - 1.8 1TiB",

    "body": "Hi! Recently I've noticed that my **CPU** fans speed up to max speed after doing, well anything. To test it, I've left the computer playing a youtube video and i didn't touch the keyboard nor the mouse - the fans acted normal. However after i opened discord or quite frankly any other application the fans instantly ramp up to max speed, just to after like 5-15 seconds slow down, and then speed up. This also happens after doing something inside an app eg. loading a discord server/sending a message.\n\nI don't think that this is a hardware issue. Here are some specs (if any more data is needed, I'll provide it when asked):\n- i5-11600K (i don't overclock)\n- 32 GB of RAM\n- NVIDIA GTX 1660 Ti\n- I use KDE Plasma (wayland) (KWin)\n- kernel: linux-zen 6.17.7-zen1-1-zen ",

Thank you\n\nUPDATE: Solved! The answer was in the github issues thread, which I had overlooked initially. All I had to do was install `python-setuptools` via pacman. Though there are comments in this thread discussing about how setuptools won't be available at the end of the year, as well as alternate methods I should've done to install. Thank you to everyone who commented!",

I've also checked the desktop files of one that's behaving correctly and one that isn't, but there isn't any difference.\n\nI sometimes have to recreate the shortcut until it opens correctly, or if I'm lucky, i just need to change the link slightly (http to https, vice versa, or remove it completely)\n\n  \nHas anyone else experienced this issue, or any ideas what might be causing this?\n\n",

    "body": "I understand. I do. You create the next great library, and everybody wants to use it, so other packages start adding your package as a dependency. Fine. Of course. That's how it works.\n\nAnd you keep developing your package, fixing bugs, adding features. Naturally.\n\nBut when a package decides to depend on a specific feature of a library dependency that it added in version X.Y.Z, do they have to depend explicitly on version X.Y.Z in the library linkage? In the package description?\n\nIf a library adds a feature at a major version increment, say, oh, I dunno, version 76. Then, it makes sense for a dependent package to specify that it needs at least 76 of that library, because it goes to reason that a feature add is not going to evaporate with version 77, 78, etc. It'll be there in perpetuity. And if it does have to be removed, it makes sense that dependent packages will just update their dependencies for one last release that works with the old library, and then change their package to not depend on that specific feature and update their dependencies for a new release that can use the newer library without that feature moving forward. Fine.\n\nBut if I have version 76 of the library installed, and your package depends explicitly on version 76, then if that library gets upgraded to, oh, I dunno, say version 78, if I can't update your package, because it's not a publicly available package, because your executables require, say, libicui18n-76, and upgrading to icu-78 removed it, because it can't know your out-of-band package depends on it, YOUR PACKAGE IS GONNA BREAK!\n\nThe package in question was my company's ZScaler VPN. And its dependency was indeed on libicu\\*-76. If ZScaler's executables just depended on libicu\\*, instead of libicu\\*-76, nothing bad would have happened.\n\nLuckily, my Linux workstation can still reach out to the public internet when the ZScaler fails, I just lose access to all in-house resources.\n\nI just did `sudo tar -xvf /var/cache/pacman/pkg/icu-76.1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst usr/lib/libicu*.so.76* -C /` piecemeal until ZScaler would run again.\n\nProblem was, that wasn't my first resort. First, I tried to just `sudo pacman -Up /var/cache/pacman/pkg/icu-76.1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst`. And that revealed a half dozen packages that depended explicitly on icu-78. So, they needed to be downgraded back to their previous version that only depended on icu-76 as well.\n\nThen, `pacman` stopped working.\n\nOr course `yay` was crippled as well.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause they depended on icu-78 explicitly as well. They just didn't have it listed in their dependencies.\n\nThat's why `pacman` cheerfully lobotomized itself when I told it to roll back icu to version 76, when the `pacman` executable explicitly depended on icu-78 libraries. Double checked `pacman -Qi pacman`. Nope! Nary a mention of icu at all.",

    "title": "[SOLUTION] Standby/Suspend Issues on Linux – Permanently Disable ACPI Wakeup",
    "body": "**PERFORM AT YOUR OWN RISK!**  \nIncorrect usage can cause your system to behave unexpectedly.\n\n# Introduction\n\nAfter a long search, I finally found the cause of my standby/suspend problem. In my case, it was certain ACPI wakeup entries that are enabled by default and prevent the system from entering suspend mode properly.\n\nBy manually disabling individual entries and creating a small script, it’s now possible to get suspend working reliably.\n\n# 1. Identifying the Problem\n\nOpen a terminal and check your wakeup configuration—for example, with:\n\n    cat /proc/acpi/wakeup\n\nEntries that are set to **enabled** can prevent the standby mode from working.\n\nTo test it, you can disable an entry like this:\n\n    sudo sh -c 'echo PTXH &gt; /proc/acpi/wakeup'\n\n⚠️ **WARNING:**  \nOn my system it was the entry **PTXH** that prevented suspend from working. On your system it might be a different one. So you must replace **PTXH** with the entry that is causing the issue on your machine.\n\nThe state will then switch from **enabled** to **disabled**.\n\n📌 **Note:**  \nTest after each disabled entry using:\n\n    systemctl suspend\n\nIf suspend works, you’ve found the culprit.\n\n# 2. Wakeup Resets After Every Restart\n\nSince the file `/proc/acpi/wakeup` resets to default after every boot, you need a script that runs automatically at startup.\n\nMy file looked like this (yours may differ):\n\n*(screenshot reference omitted)*\n\n# ✅ Step-by-Step Guide\n\n# 1. Create a Bash Script\n\nCreate a script:\n\nGo to the path `/usr/local/bin/` and create a new text file there (e.g., using the editor *Kate*).\n\nInsert the following:\n\n    #!/bin/bash\n    \n    # Check if PTXH is enabled and disable it if necessary\n    if grep -q \"PTXH.*enabled\" /proc/acpi/wakeup; then\n        echo \"PTXH\" &gt; /proc/acpi/wakeup\n    fi\n\nSave it in the path above under the name [**disable-ptxh.sh**](http://disable-ptxh.sh) and close the editor.\n\nMake the script executable:\n\n    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/disable-ptxh.sh\n\n# 2. Create a Systemd Service to Run the Script at Boot\n\nCreate a service file:\n\nGo to the path `/etc/systemd/system/` and create a new text file there (e.g., with *Kate*).\n\nInsert the following:\n\n    [Unit]\n    Description=Disable PTXH ACPI Wakeup\n    After=multi-user.target\n    \n    [Service]\n    Type=oneshot\n    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/disable-ptxh.sh\n    \n    [Install]\n    WantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nSave it under the name **disable-ptxh.service** and close the editor.\n\n# 3. Enable the Service\n\n    sudo systemctl daemon-reload\n    sudo systemctl enable disable-ptxh.service\n\n(Optional: test immediately)\n\n    sudo systemctl start disable-ptxh.service\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWith this method, I was finally able to stop a specific ACPI entry from blocking suspend mode. If you’re experiencing similar problems, it’s worth checking the entries in `/proc/acpi/wakeup` and disabling the ones causing issues.\n\nGood luck — and as always: make system changes at your own responsibility!\n\n",

    "title": "Things that tripped me up doing a fresh installation",
    "body": "Mercifully the only time I have to deal with Windoze is being the IT manager for my 82-year-old mom and her Lenovo Ideapad S145.\n\nI foolishly told her to accept Microsoft's kind offer of Windows 11 since its constant popups and threats made her even more confused than usual. Long story short, her laptop went from glacially slow to completely frozen, and in the most recent forced \"upgrade\", the Wifi along with its icon get deleted for some reason only Microsoft knows every other reboot.\n\nAnyways, I thought why not install Arch on an old USB storage device I no longer use. Since she mainly just uses her computer to watch youtube videos bashing Harry and Meghan, she doesn't really need anything fancy. She does use Teams to talk to various friends around the world, so a \"dual boot system\" from either the external drive for Arch or internal drive for Windoze seemed a smart idea.\n\nI have kinda gotten this all to work, but it's been way more frustrating than I thought it would be.\n\nThe main headache has been Lenovo's eratic boot menu. Pressing F2 only gets me into the boot screen once every six or so attempts, so a real dice roll.\n\nEven if I instructed the BIOS to give the USB device priority, once Windoze loads, it seems to put itself first on the list again. This means my mom can't simply switch between Linux and Windoze without me pressing F2 dozens of times to get the external drive booting again.\n\nI've now got xfce with Firefox running, and Lenovo's BIOS willing, the laptop boots straight into the windows environment.\n\nNext snag I hadn't encountered before was pacstrap refusing to install a basic system because of key problems. Courtesy of Google I discovered the magic incantation to fix this was:\n\n```\npacman-key --init\npacman-key --populate archlinux\n```\n\nThe next two biggest headaches, predictably, have been sound and WiFi. Xfce's default sound panel applet simply refused to work, so I had to install Pulseaudio even though bare Alsa is supposedly all you need. Something that's a big plus from a few years ago is Alsa is no longer muted by default to trip most newbies up. But I simply couldn't get volume control to work without an additional middleman.\n\nSomething I haven't encountered before is phy0 and wlan0 are powered off by default in the Lenovo laptop, so getting iwd to work took a bit of googling. Since iwd and systemd played nicely together and the wifi was up and running on first boot, I decided to just leave them.\n\nThe snag again is getting a working panel applet. No luck getting iwgtk to work, and I see it's no longer maintained anyway. So it looks like I'll have to switch from iwd and systemd to wpa_supplicant and NetManager so as to use its app.\n\nLong story short, it's been not as easy as I'd hoped, but now hopefully won't randomly break all the time like Windoze 11.",

    "body": "This caught me completely by surprise today. I wasn't aware that they were re-writing the UI and switching to Qt. Imagine my face when I ran my daily system update and saw 255MB of dependencies asking to be installed. I get that GTK4 was a pain to work with and you could tell that it was, the interface was working but felt kludgy. However, dumping 255MB of dependencies for all the non KDE users and especially for those that run lightweight DEs, onto a 7.8MB app, is a hard pill to swallow. Especially considering there isn't another program that is as easy to use and feature rich as EasyEffects. Sure, you could build all your effects chains with LSP-plugins and Carla or something else but EasyEffects holds true to its name. It's easy.\n\nI'm gonna hold off on updating for now but eventually I'll either have to go through the hassle of setting up an alternative or bite the bullet. Any Hyprland, XFCE or Sway or other lightweight DE users here that have any opinions on this? Did you just bite the bullet and install all the deps or have you built an alternative setup?\n\nEdit: Guys, it's not about the storage space. It's about having to install a whole ecosystem for one app. Bloat isn't just an expression of used storage space.\n\nEdit2: Just to clarify further. KDE is not a dependency of Qt. EasyEffects is using kirigami and all that brings along. KDE widgets, breeze-icons etc. You can build an app using Qt6 without all of those things. I may not have made that clear enough initially but I already have all the Qt libraries installed. The 255MB are all KDE stuff, none of it is Qt. That is the core of my complaint. Why all the KDE stuff?\n\nEdit3: Many assume it's about the MB count but that's not it. I'm also surprised they're all missing the point. They chose Arch as their distro. If they're not at least annoyed by this, why didn't they go with any of the other distros that are pre-built? Arch is a DIY distro, having to install stuff you don't want kinda goes against the spirit of Arch. If you don't care about what deps a program pulls in and you're not bothered by having thousands of packages on your system, why did you go with Arch? Why go through all of the hassle of installing Arch if in the end, you don't care? Wouldn't have Manjaro or one of the Ubuntu based distros been more appropriate?",

    "body": "I got myself a new laptop just to play skyrim during my calculus courses, and I'll tell you the story of me trying to install arch on this new device.\n\nI was in one of my calculus courses and got bored, looking for something more... enjoyable(?). At that time I've saw a guy using his laptop to play chess online. He was avoiding boredom, unlike me. That was the spark. I was gonna get a laptop just to play skyrim in class!\n\nI searched the web and found out there is a freedos not good, not bad laptop that respects my wallet. I ordered it online and it arrived 4 days ago. The device I'm talking about is lenovo ideapad 3 15ABR8. It's not fascinating in hardware but I already got a great machine at home that covers all my needs except mobility. So it works for me.\n\nDay-1 installing arch linux on my new pc.  \nI already had a Ventoy all in one Os usb, so I didn’t waste time preparing the installation. The arch iso on my usb was only a month old so there shouldn't have been a problem I taught. I'll cut fast these parts but I failed miserably over and over again. In the \"Rapidly fail\" process I updated my arch iso in the usb, tried manual and archinstall methods, however it didn't worked. I gave up and installed W\\*ndows as a substitute os.\n\nDay-2 &amp; 3 Trying to coop with W\\*ndows.  \nI didn't used windows on my computer like in 2(?) years. It was a little hard to getting used to it. I installed my desired apps, plugins etc. to pc and updated drivers at my 2nd day. It was all good and sweet till I decided to uninstall some of the out-of-the-box apps on day 3. I uninstalled On\\*drive... It fucked up my folder system. I got frustrated and swore to god I'll not gonna use windows and delete it immediately. I slept. It was my bed anyway.\n\nDay-4 Changing to another OS and coming back to home...  \nDay-4 is actually today, I woke up and directly rushed to my pc changing my os to fedora. I had no problems with the fedora installation. It was a sweet relief to see anything but W\\*ndows on my desktop wallpaper. I was tinkering around and eventually opened the terminal. I was gonna install spotify so I entered 'sudo pacman -Syu spotify-launcher'... I felt like I'm in the enemy territory as there was no command called pacman. I ofc know fedora does not use pacman packet manager, but that's what I used to do. I uninstalled fedora too and got my self warmed up to fight. To fight to install arch! I literally wore jeans and a shirt just to get a moral boost.\n\nI started the installation media. I was too careful this time, there was no room for any mistakes. I read every line my eyes could keep up with during the installation process. I slowly partitioned my ssd. Sometimes caressed my monitor as a good luck charm. Failed 3 times this way. After all that, I called a friend. Let's call him Duke. Duke is a cs student, and he is much more familiar with linux and all computers then me. My friend Duke gave me a real advice, 'I'm busy use ai'. I used chatgpt. It also failed to help me but we tried and tried. Installed 3 different arch iso files with rufus, ventoy and balenaetcher just to be 'sure'. We got stuck connecting to wifi sometimes, but in the end we find the problem.\n\nWhen I '/ls boot'ed, while in chroot, there was no fallback image for linux. Even after we overwrote linux, linux-firmware, and mkinitcpio with new installations and redesigned the initramfs 2 to 3 times, there was still no fallback images in /boot. I got curious and look in the initramfs-linux.preset with cat. There was the problem. All lines containing initramfs-linux-fallback.img were commented out. I asked for a correct copy of linux.preset and edited it the way gpt described using nano. Here are the lines it suggested.\n\n&gt;!\\# mkinitcpio preset file for the 'linux' package!&lt;\n\n&gt;!ALL\\_config=\"/etc/mkinitcpio.conf\"!&lt;\n\n&gt;!ALL\\_kver=\"/boot/vmlinuz-linux\"!&lt;\n\n&gt;!PRESETS=('default' 'fallback')!&lt;\n\n&gt;!default\\_image=\"/boot/initramfs-linux.img\"!&lt;\n\n&gt;!default\\_options=\"\"!&lt;\n\n&gt;!fallback\\_image=\"/boot/initramfs-linux-fallback.img\"!&lt;\n\n&gt;!fallback\\_options=\"-S autodetect\"!&lt;\n\nAfter editing linux.preset when I generated initramfs and looked in the boot, there was the initramfs-linux-fallback.img. I reinstalled systemd-boot end rebooted my device. I was victorius.\n\nNow I'm happily installing my skyrim. ",

I went back to x11 cinnamon and all of a sudden vulkan stopped working and I don’t know why.

My computer screen randomly turns off sometimes now and then turns on again. \n\nI decided that okay what the hell I’ll just move my stuff to a usb and then reinstall everything because I’m stupid and I don’t know what else to do. But then I spilled my water on my computer because I’m STUPID. My computer is fine but I unplugged my usb on impulse and now the usb won’t mount. This usb has all of my mom’s pictures of me as a child along with several backups of things (it has 2 tb of storage and I’m pretty sure my family has been using it for years) and now I’m super scared because I think I ruined it. I’m on the verge of having a mental breakdown right now and I don’t want to bother my dad about it because he already told me not to do anything stupid and wreck my computer and guess what! I was stupid again\n\nIf anybody knows how to fix my usb without deleting everything on it that would be a big help (or if you know how to fix any of my other problems). I’m sorry if this isn’t the right place I don’t know where else to look because none of the tutorials I searched up worked. And now I can’t even just reinstall linux because the usb with my backups isn’t there!!!\n\n\n",

It will still store its config files on G:.\n\n• \tGrub2Win will detect the EFI partition and install the bootloader there\n\n• \tYou can then store your ISOs and config on G:\n\nThis is the standard setup for GPT systems.\n\n🔸 Option 2: Convert Disk to MBR (Not Recommended)\n\nYou could wipe the disk and convert it to MBR to get full control over “Primary” and “Active” flags — but this is risky and unnecessary unless you're doing legacy BIOS booting.\n\ncan someone help me give me suggestions or help me choose?\n\nUpdate - (again)\n\nturns out there are alternatives to grub ( im stupid )\n\nill be trying rEFind (sorry if i spelt that incorrectly)\n\nalso i havent even started doing arch yet, im still on making the drive then putting arch on there\n\nwish me luck lol\n\n\\- Update - im going crazy\n\nthe page where the refind file is supposed to be is literally a labrynth,\n\ncopilot says \" look for a file like...\" the problem is looking for that goddamn file is like looking for a needle in an incredibly large haystack the size of the moon, why? because along the way theres like a billion different links, so the haybale also has a bunch of fake needles in it i will continuing updating but i hope that someone may be able to help me\n\n\\- update - im using easybcd now, im pretty sure 10 people working together cant install refind\n\n\\- another one - bcd doesnt work aswell because no iso files are accepted (im actually mentally unstable)\n\ndo i run it through a VM?\n\nUPDATE!!!!\n\non my boot menu theres arch linux now...\n\ncrasy, right?\n\ni mean i did download a vm but i dunno if thats causing it\n\nwhen i select it however an error message appears\n\nim gonna come back and tell you guys what it says\n\nBACK, it says that there was a problem with booting windows or something but im not trying to boot windows\n\nit said something about hardware",

    "body": "I gave it about 63 days before I gave up on it. 60 days ago I thought it was awesome. The past 2 weeks it was just annoying. When it became a bootable iso image I was pretty sure they were going to lose me. I didn't want a new distro. I wanted Arch with a a preconfigured Hyprland and development environment.\n\nI think it is kind of funny/sad how the mindset is is break free from your Mac and then they give you a version of Arch that is becoming more and more Mac like in the sense that you need to use Alacritty if you want these tui's to work right, and their modified chromium if you want these web apps to work right. And, oh I see you changed your keybinds, we're going to just change those back even though you did it the way we suggested. DHH has come up with some newer ones and you'll probably like them better than yours.  What? It changes your whole workflow? Funny you should mention that because we're also going to replace your neovim settings too. You might as well just do things our way.\n\nYeah I know it is an opinionated install, I didn't realize it was going to be opinionated updates as well. Just not for me. I did get some benefit from using it. I discovered lazygit and a few other terminal based applications.\n\nSo now that I am back to a fresh Arch install I figured I would give Cosmic a go. I must say I am pretty impressed with it. I like being able to set tiling or floating per work space.\n\n\\*edit\\*\n\nI had a 2nd PC with Omarchy installed, a little HP Mini. I ended up removing Omarchy tonight and keeping my Arch install by doing the following steps.\n\nDisable the Omarchy seamless login service and renable tty1\n\n    sudo systemctl stop omarchy-seamless-login.service\n    sudo systemctl daemon-reload \n    sudo systemctl start getty@tty1.service\n\nIt is easier if you log in on tty2 (ctrl-alt f2) to do this, When you stop the seamless login service it might kick you to a black screen. Once you get rid of the auto login you can also remove the omarchy decryption graphic and replace it with something prettier. You only need to do this if you are using an encrypted disk. If you aren't using LUKS just skip to the .config folder part.\n\n\"plymouth-set-default-theme -l\" will show a list of the themes. I went with bgrt which is basically the spinner theme with your bios or PC manufacturer's boot logo. You need to make sure you specify the -R flag so it will rebuild the initramfs.\n\n    sudo plymouth-set-default-theme -R bgrt\n\nAt this stage I decided to just move my .config folder and start with a fresh one. You don't have to do this part. If you decide to keep your .config folder and keep hyprland, there is a pretty good chance it will get updated back to omarchy again.\n\n    cd \n    mv .config/ .config.bak \n    mkdir .config\n\nThen I just copied over folders I wanted to preserve and omitted things I didn't mind rebuilding from scratch. Below are just some examples. One thing of note. Omarchy symlinks the themes to a lot of their stuff so if you copy nvim or any of your terminal customizations you might want to consider copying the omarchy folder. At the time of writing this, it only has a themes folder and a current theme folder.\n\n    cd .config\n    cp -r ../.config.bak/chromium .\n    cp -r ../.config.bak/retroarch .\n    cp -r ../.config.bak/nvim .\n\nYou can reboot here. You should get a new plymouth screen with the Arch logo at the bottom and whatever theme you picked\n\nFinally you need to get rid of the omarchy mirror and update your mirror list.\n\n    sudo nvim /etc/pacman.conf\n\nscroll down and comment out or remove these lines.\n\n    [omarchy] \n    SigLevel = Optional TrustAll \n    Server = https://pkgs.omarchy.org/$arch\n\nSave it and then run this to rebuild your mirror list\n\n    sudo pacman -Syyu\n\nAt this point you just need to do one more thing, remove omarchy-chromium\n\n    sudo pacman -R omarchy-chromium\n\nYou can re-install the real Chromium if you want it. Having the omarchy fork there will be problematic if you ever want to update Chromium.\n\nNow you are free to install whatever desktop and window manager you would like to use. If you install SDDM you can set that to auto login and go right into whatever you install.\n\nOmarchy is still going to exist in .local/share/omarchy as a git repo. I am keeping it there so I can cannibalize their themes. :)\n\nI hope this proves useful to some people and gets you back to just using Arch btw.",

But quick search made me discover another pretty cool way: [Arch Linux Archive](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Linux_Archive#How_to_restore_all_packages_to_a_specific_date). \n\nTLDR: You can specify date, and \"rollback\" all packages to the state of Arch repos at that time. No dependencies trouble with rollbacking nvidia, kernel, etc.\n\nI just edited `/etc/pacman.conf` \n\n```\n[core]\nServer=https://archive.archlinux.org/repos/2025/02/25/$repo/os/$arch\n#Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist\n\n[extra]\nServer=https://archive.archlinux.org/repos/2025/02/25/$repo/os/$arch\n#Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist\n\n[multilib]\nServer=https://archive.archlinux.org/repos/2025/02/25/$repo/os/$arch\n#Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist\n```\nrun `pacman -Syyuu` and voila, I am back to nvidia-open 570.86.16-9 with the right kernel and everything.

It assumes that someone that comes from Windons/Mac wants something that's similar, which I feel is dumb, because they switching away right?

Make sure you have python-pipx installed via pacman. note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages. hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.\"\n\n\n\nNow I'm just annoyed and having my fking time wasted.

While the Installation guide is pretty good, there's several little things you probably should do to your system after install, or right now if you never done it before.\n\n* Bootloader\n\nYou should enable automatic updates for your specific bootloader.\n\nSystemd-boot - https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-boot#Automatic_update\n\nGrub - https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GRUB#Warning_to_perform_grub-install/grub-mkconfig_at_each_grub_update\n\nFor others check https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_boot_process\n\n* Locale\n\nIf you use your system in English  but lives outside the US you should set up your locale.conf accordingly, ex.\n\n    LANG=de_DE.UTF-8\n    LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8\n    LC_COLLATE=C.UTF-8\n\n\nIn my case `LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8` guarantee while the system is in English, while `LANG=en_DE.UTF-8` makes that all the other settings are set up to the local German standards.\n\nLC_COLLATE=C.UTF-8 is recommended to be set as `C.UTF-8` by the wiki.\n\nThere's also several other variables that can be set individually but are probably not necessary for the vast majority of people.\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Locale\n\n^Shoutout ^to ^/u/legacynl\n\n* Trim\n\nEnable Trim on your SSDs, either with the discard mount option if you drive and file system support it or using the fstrim.service.\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Solid_state_drive#TRIM\n\n* Makepkg\n\nIf you're constantly using AUR packages you should enable makepkg optimizations. \n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Makepkg#Optimization\n\n* Fonts\n\nInstall the noto-fonts-cjk (or other CJK font pack) so you don't see a bunch of empty squares when people use Chinese Japanese or Korean characters.\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fonts\n\n* Mirrors\n\nInstall and set up Reflector service to keep your mirrors up to date \n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Reflector\n\n* .pacnew\n\nPackage updates will often generate .pacnew files, those files are new config files that have new options or new standards and need to be dealt with promptly. What I do is just run\n\n `$ pacman -Syu &amp;&amp; pacdiff` \n\nand I deal with them immediately, or you can just run \n\n`$ pacdiff` \n\nonce in a while. Not dealing with .pacnew files might cause you problems in the future.\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman/Pacnew_and_Pacsave\n\n* Package cache\n\nClean your package cache periodically so you don't end up with several GB of packages just sitting around.\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman#Cleaning_the_package_cache\n\n* Zram\n\nYou should probably update your old SWAP partiton to Zram, it's better in every way possible, the only caveat is hibernation, I don't use it and I don't know if it's possible to use Zram and still have hibernation.\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Zram\n\nThere's certainly more stuff that I can't think of right now, but leave your tips and I'll update the post with the best ones.",

Not all or even most Arch users, but let's not kid ourselves; they 100% are a loudvocal minority of our group. lol\n\nI've been using Arch as my main OS for over 15 years. When I first started using (roughly 2008-2010, Arch came with an ncurses installer and offline packages bundled in the ISO.\n\nI even quit using Arch for a couple weeks/months once they got rid of it but got so tired of Mint (or whatever I used in its place) that I decided I'd nut up and learn the goddamn manual install process. lmfao\n\nI'm all for making it accessible. Learning manual install process and related commands is useful for learning what goes into a Linux system in general and how to fix problems down the road whether in Arch or another distro, but having an installer is just a convenient feature that does far more good than bad.\n\nMight get us more \"how does i shot arch btw i want the pewdiepie desktop bro\" noob posts, but it's also going to make it more accessible and less intimidating to people who are intellectually endowed and could grow to contribute to the community one day.\n\nAlso funny: It's been so long since there was an Arch installation menu, I have the whole manual installation process memorized and can do it in well under half an hour (never timed myself or anything), so I've never bothered with archinstall script. Ought to next time just to see how it compares to what I remember the ancient install menu having. lmfao",

I like challenges and they thought \"why not jump into cold Waters.\"  \n\nI started installing It on an VM, you know just to get started. Later I found out 90% of my issues were caused by said VM and not by Arch itself. Lol\n\nSure I spent like 2 hours to get it running like I wanted to. Sure I had to read the wiki a shitton. But my god the wiki. I love the wiki so much. Genuinely I'm convinced if you just READ arch isn't that bad. Everything is explained, and everything has links that explain the stuff that isn't explained. \n\nAnd the best part about my 2 hours slamming my keyboard with button inputs to put everything in FOOT (don't judge, I couldn't get kitty to run, and when I was finally able to run it foot kinda looked nice to me lol)... Now I understand every inch of my system. Not like in windows where honestly most registry files are still a mystery to me. No! I've spent so much time in the wiki and hammering in the same commands over and over and editing configs that I understand every tiny little detail of my system. I see something I don't like and know how to change it, or at least I know how to find out how to change it. (The wiki most times lol)\n\nAnd don't even get me started about Pacman. Jesus fucking Christ I've never had fun installing programs in windows before. Pacman is just no bs, get me to where I need to be. (Similarly to KDE Discover, but I've heard it's not so nice since it keeps infos from Pacman, oh well, pacman is good enough even without gui)\n\nThe entire experience was just fun.

Installed Arch Linux + Hyprland again with the help of Arch wiki, success!]\n\nI see a lot of noobs asking the simplest questions in certain subreddits which is justified because well, they are noobs. I was a noob too, actually I'm still a noob and I'm learning about linux. I've come across numerous YouTube videos, blogs and articles about 'linuxing' but none of them clicked. I started out with Debian and really liked how Linux worked without any abstractions. \n\nI dived into the world of linux distro and learned about distro hopping quickly. But at this point I didn't know jackshit about linux, I only used it as a newbie. \n\nEver since I laid my eyes on Arch, I was determined to make Arch my own ('my own' as in being the power user Arch actually expects. Sorry my vocabulary limits me from using more sophisticated words as English is not my first language and I can't put my real feelings behind these words). Also there's this cool prestige among people that Arch Linux users are just better. So I typed 'Arch Linux' on my browser, visited the official website and installed the ISO. And of course, I chose to go with the hardest path i.e, manual installation. Guess what? I failed miserably and I couldn't really understand what was happening behind the hood. I felt defeated and chose to switch to EndeavourOS KDE because I wanted to try out Arch without having to deal with the hassle of installation. \n\n6 months later, I decided that it was time to install arch with hyprland. But this time, I had knowledge about the archinstall script. I installed Arch with no issues at all. This time though, there was another issue. Hyprland. I had no fucking clue about what I was balls deep in. In the end, I failed again.\n\nI had to restore my EndeavourOS setup with Timeshift(thank God I had created a backup earlier). I decided to try again but this time I was determined and clicked every single link I came across while reading the Arch Wiki. I mean yes, it took me a lot of time to install the OS but guess what? I actually knew what I was doing this time. Oh and btw I did all of this in gnome-boxes because I was scared of breaking my system. Now I just gotta do this again which won't take much time ;).\n\nBasically my point in writing this huge ass article is that please stop searching for easier alternatives such as YouTube videos and go read the Arch Wiki. There's tons of information in there and many more I still haven't discovered yet! You'll find everything you seek about Arch and Linux in general in there.\n\nI'll post the screenshots of my setup in the comments after I install Arch on my laptop.\n\nThanks for reading!",

I discovered Neovim and fell in love with it - kudos to the Vim creators!\n\nThe hype around Arch kept catching my attention. After some research, I discovered it centered around Arch's DIY philosophy. Curiosity got the better of me, so I decided to give it a shot in a VM first.\n\nI spent about a week learning the installation process through the ArchWiki, Reddit, and some AI assistance. As I dove deeper, each new term led me down fascinating rabbit holes of knowledge. The Wiki's structure is brilliant - it guides you while encouraging exploration of related concepts. I can confidently say the ArchWiki is the finest documentation I've encountered on the internet. It's not just documentation; it's a masterpiece.\n\nDuring this process, I created my own documentation in Obsidian, and ultimately gained a deep understanding of the GNU/Linux system. When I finally installed Arch on my actual machine, I barely needed to reference anything (except for a post-installation audio issue) - it all came naturally.\n\nI now understand that truly knowing Linux comes from building and maintaining your system yourself.

One of my subjects requires me to compile a micro OS called XINU which was built on an ancient build of gcc. Having access to old versions of gcc through the AUR saved me soo much time. I was able to build and test locally without using the slow university servers.\n\n2. Another course requires me to write mpi programs to implement parallel algos and installing openmpi, running the programs across various cores was seamless. Unlike my friend who has an M1 pro macbook, I did not have to fiddle with any settings or break my head in figuring out why the code was not compiling.\n\n3. My operating system course also had in depth studies on how linux works and using linux gave me an easy way to see real world examples of how linux scheduling, memory management and threading works.\n\nAll of these may seem minor, but they were huge time savers and helped me focus on coding rather than fighting with the OS.

I update every 2-3 days, and its been rock solid.\n\nRecently set up a HP 600 G3 micro pc for the TV to act as media server and steam remote play, and I figured it would make sense to make it a \"stable\" system, so I wouldn't be constantly monitoring it for updates.\n\nAll for different reasons: Chimera, Mint Debian, Zorin, Fedora, all had problems ranging from irritating to broken within a week. Its now got Debian w/ plasma installed, which decided to kill itself when I ran an apt autoremove and took out the whole DE - easy enough fix but I've NEVER had arch decide that install-time packages could be flagged as no longer needed and uninstall them.\n\nThroughout all this, my gf has been watching my frustration. Yesterday she asks me \"why don't you just install the same thing as your desktop pc?\"\n\nThe irony that my bleeding edge desktop was more stable than all these fresh installs has not been lost on me.\n\nMaybe with the end of Windows 10 and Recall creeping over the horizon I can convince her to change as well.\n\n(This post has been inspired by u/Malqus's recent post \"My GF started using Arch\", good luck to her buddy)\n\n  \nEdit: Perhaps I should've quoted the first \"stable\", as some of you guys are bringing up the reliable vs stable debate.

    "body": "The setup contains the following:\n\n* Archlinux + KDE\n* BTRFS File System with Timeshift Snapshots\n* LUKS Encryption\n* Unified Kernel Images\n* systemd Boot\n* Secure Boot with TPM 2 auto-unlock\n* Dual Boot with Windows with Bitlocker enabled\n* SWAP as a File\n* Recovery UKI and BTRFS Snapshot UKI using the LTS Kernel\n* Hardware: Lenovo L560 with Intel i5 and 16GB of RAM\n\n\tSome background to all of this: This my second time installing Archlinux. First time was a minimal bare-bones setup, using GRUB and no security measures. It was still a dual-boot setup with Windows, but no Secure Boot, no TPM and no Encryption, on either OS-es. Basically, it was just a familiarization with Linux and how it works.\n\n\tBut I loved it! The granularity with which an OS can be manipulated and configured, the privacy, the efficiency. It was all astonishing, especially when coming from a life of using Windows (since 1998).\n\n\tThere were still a lot of boxes I wanted to check. Learning about File Systems, CoW, Snapshots, Unified Kernel Images, UEFI, Secure Boot, TPM2, SWAP, Kernels, and many other things. Diving a bit deeper into how an OS works. I believe that with this setup I mostly managed to do that.\n\n\tI’m going to describe a bit of the most interesting particularities of this setup:\n\n**BTRFS File System with Timeshift Snapshots**\n\n\tBTRFS is great, providing some cool functionalities like snapshots and CoW. My goal was to use said snapshots with a simple yet effective app that had a GUI, like Timeshift. Timeshift requires a very specific layout of the btrfs subvolumes in order to work. An “@“ subvolume for the root partition and a “@home” subvolume for the Home user directory. \n\n\tI’ve seen many setups online, and people were using tons of sub-volumes when setting up their btrfs partitions. Some of them made sense, some were just there for the sake of being there. I decided that for my particular use-case, a root subvolume (“@“) and a home subvolume (“@home”) were enough (which is exactly what Timeshift requires).\n\n**Dual Boot with Windows with Bitlocker enabled and TPM2 auto-unlock for both OS-es**\n\n\tA controversial topic in the world of Archlinux was the success rate of dual-booting Archlinux and Windows, both using Secure Boot, TPM2 auto-unlock and Encryption enabled. I haven’t found many specific examples of this setup working successfully, so it was mostly trial and error on my side. I was determined to do it though, documenting myself with the specifics of UEFI, Secure Boot and TPM2. \n\n\tThe conclusion I reached is that Windows and Archlinux can flawlessly work in a dual-boot setup, both having Secure Boot and TPM2 auto-unlock enabled. The trick is to boot them directly from the UEFI Boot menu (this will allow the PCR7 Secure Boot bank to remain unchanged). If you try to boot Windows from the systemd boot menu (which will detect it as an entry), the PCR7 Secure Boot bank value will change and Bitlocker will prompt for the recovery key. Windows generally uses banks 7 and 11. For my Archlinux setup I’ve used banks 0 and 7.  \n\tEDIT: It is not the PCR 7 bank that changes and doesn't allow Windows to boot through systemd-boot, it is PCR 11, although PCR 7 also has a certain impact. As u/6e1a08c8047143c6869 pointed out: \"I think you mean PCR 11? The secure boot state (i.e. secure boot settings, keys, etc.) will not be changed by booting Windows through systemd-boot, but PCR 11 will\" and \"The issue here seems not to be that PCR 7 changes if you use sd-boot, but that Windows looks at all efi executables in the boot chain and refuses to bind the bitlocker key to PCR7 if any of them were signed by something other than themselves.\"\n\n\tOf course other banks can be used as well, for both OS-es, but the setup becomes gradually more complicated and prone to auto-unlock failure. This depends on one’s threat model.\n\n**Recovery UKI and BTRFS Snapshot UKI using the LTS Kernel**\n\n\tI always thought Safe Mode from Windows was pretty cool for debugging and troubleshooting, yet I did not know how to access something similar on linux. \n\n\tI eventually found out about systemd emergency target, so I created an UKI with mkinitcpio that had the a cmdline file addition that uses the following attribute: “systemd.unit=emergency.target”. This is used to boot the system into an “emergency / minimal” mode using systemd. From here on you can do various things since you have a shell available at your disposal. \n\n\tAnother UKI I made, was one that took advantage of the BTRFS snapshots feature. This one uses the following cmdline addition: “rootflags=subvol=/timeshift-btrfs/snapshots/YYYY-MM-DD\\\\\\_HH\\\\\\_MM\\\\\\_SS/@“ in order to create a UKI that boots a read/write snapshot directly. You can even use Timeshift from within the snapshot to restore the system to a previous point. It was pretty cool and fun when I actually got to see it boot!\n\n\tI decided that both of these \"recovery\" UKIs should use the LTS kernel, as a safety measure. The standard boot entries use the stable Linux kernel.\n\nI basically had 3 cmdline files in my /etc/kernel folder and 2 mkinitcpio presets (linux and linux-lts)\n\n1. The default one “cmdline” using the stable kernel.\n2. The emergency one “cmdline\\_recovery” using the LTS kernel.\n3. The snapshot one “cmdline\\_snapshot” using the LTS kernel as well.\n\nMy boot menu looks like this: [Bootmenu](https://imgur.com/a/rJVx1Nc)\n\nEDIT: When creating this setup I also wrote a full and fairly detailed guide/tutorial on it, just in case I needed to replicate the setup in the future and knowing that there is no way I'd just remember everything in it.\n\nSome people asked for the guide, so here it is: [Guide](https://drive.proton.me/urls/GKX84G630W#X49lqq0aYNYc) (I uploaded it on Proton Drive).\n\nEDIT2: As u/AppointmentNearby161 pointed out, only binding to PCRs measured pre-boot (PCRs 0-7) opens a vulnerability from rogue operating systems. A rogue partition with metadata copied from the real root filesystem (such as partition UUID) can mimic the original partition. More can be read about this on the [Archlinux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-cryptenroll#Trusted_Platform_Module). I also modified the guide to reflect this and to suggest a few potential fixes (be aware that I didn't had the time to test these fixes yet, so implement them with caution).",

I still tinker a little here and there, but I've learned a lot on the way, so the last couple months my system has been nothing but stable.

This issue happened after that with `20250613.12fe085f-6`\n\nTL;DR: after the manual intervention that updated linux-firmware-amdgpu to `20250613.12fe085f-5` (which worked fine) a new update was posted to version `20250613.12fe085f-6` , this version broke systems with Radeon 9000 series GPUs, causing unresponsive/unusable slow systems after a reboot. The work around was to downgrade to -5 and skip -6.\n\nWhy did Arch not issue a rollback immediately or at least post a warning on the homepage where one will normally check? On reddit alone so many users have been affected, but once the issue has been identified, there was no need for more users to get their systems messed up.\n\nYes, I know its free. I am not demanding improvement, I just want to understand as someone who works in IT and deals with software rollouts and a host of users myself.\n\nFor context: [https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/linux-firmware/-/issues/17](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/linux-firmware/-/issues/17)\n\nUpdate: Dev's explanation: [https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1lkoyh4/comment/mzujx9u/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1lkoyh4/comment/mzujx9u/?context=3)",

    "body": "As I was doing an upgrade for some unknown reason the upgrade of the pacman itself failed and left me without a package manager.\n\nNo problem - boot the ISO and use it to install pacman with pacstrap. This was a bit messy, because my root partition isn't big enough, so I moved the pacman cache to the /home partition, but pacstrap wouldn't have it. Never mind, just remove the pkg symlink and make an empty directory instead.\n\nSo pacman is installed and it's time to arch-chroot and finish the system upgrade now. One small problem - I forgot to mount the boot partition, which resulted in the kernel going to wrong place and an unbootable system. Another small problem, I don't remember how I've setup the system boot. The system boots directly (only Arch on it), but I don't remember if I used a boot manager and which one was it.\n\nOK, time to install a boot manager. Just a simple one. Maybe I was using [rEFInd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/REFInd). I installed it and voila - a bootable system again. So breakage fixed. In fact two breakages - one caused by pacman and a second one caused by me. Now I can say Arch broke on me, btw! It took a few years, but I got the badge.\n\nIn the end it turns out that rEFInd was not the boot manager I wanted, because it displays a wacky boot menu. I replaced it with systemd-boot and now we'll see if I have a bootable system on my next reboot, which will be next month.\n",

So my dumbass thought let's format that partition from Windows Disk Management and I will install Arch on that partition and that was a huge mistake. \n\nAs I rebooted after formatting, I saw the grub command line which scared me a bit(seeing for the first time) but after searching online on how to boot from .efi file I booted into Windows, removed grub(after some online research) flashed Arch on a USB, booted into the USB and lo and behold I can install Arch now.\nI thought I could go the easy way with arch install but that didn't support dual boot ig or I couldn't figure out how to setup dual boot from arch install.\n\nActually Arch wiki is the best way to install Arch after 2 hours installing it for the 3rd time(1st install had mounted drives setup incorrectly and in the 2nd I messed up the Grub setup) it finally worked, booted from Grub Menu at Reboot everything worked fine, but wait a minute there is no Windows boot option in the Grub Menu because for some reason os-prober wasn't finding the Windows efi file, had to make a manual entry for Windows in the Grub Menu(prior research on where Windows efi file existed actually helped) and viola it's 3am(started at 11 pm if I remember correctly) and both Windows and Arch are booting properly.\n\n\n\nBonus: In the morning when I again boot Arch to install that quickshell and hyprland theme, iwctl didn't work(which it did in the setup) because it doesn't exist so again I boot the USB, mounted the drives correctly(I am good at it now) downloaded nmcli from inside there, removed the USB and now I could connect to the WiFi finally. Rest is history as it was smooth sailing from there onwards I still haven't had any issues from Arch except from caelestia-dots and quickshell which were fairly easy and minute fixes not really related to arch.\n\nThose 3-4 hours I spent installing actually helped me learn a lot more about how these software and hardware behave and is a journey I will probably remember for a long time.\n\n\n\nPS.  The caelestia theme is sexy, and installing Arch is not that hard I don't know what everyone is on about everywhere.",

If we help new Arch users a few things could happen:\n\n\n\n* More people will be using Arch (great for our community).\n* The benefits of Arch will be spread, by newbies sharing with others.\n* Newbies will eventually learn and may develop their own packages to contribute to the cause.\n* They may gain a deep appreciation for what makes Arch special (a DIY approach to distros).\n\n\n\nLinus Torvalds philosophy for Linux is free, open source software for all. Giving the user the power. Linux is great because it's more secure, highly customizable, gives you a great degree of control, and it's private. I'm tired of people misleading others, telling them to read the f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* manual (RTFM), and telling them not to use Arch.\n\n\n\nJust 2 weeks ago I successfully built my first Arch distro and it still has not had any issues. I used Ubuntu before, but switched because I don't believe in Canonicals' bad practices. If you are one of the Arch users who takes time to help newbies thank you!

Many of the free written responses expressed a great deal of gratitude to you, and that gratitude is well deserved! Without you, this community simply wouldn't be, so thank you!\n* [Brodie Robertson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSyUvkpHv6M&amp;t=37s)! Thank you for showcasing our survey on your channel! It was unexpected, but thanks to your help, our survey had a significant increase in reach, and we appreciate it very much!\n* All **3,923** who participated! Without you, the snapshot of data we were able to capture wouldn't be what it is. So thank you for your time and contribution!\n* All who provided feedback! you've given us many tools and perspectives for use in the future, and have proven the value of community wisdom, so thank you very much!\n\n**Acknowledgement of Flaws**\n\n* Sample size: While we did see a significant sample, there may be variance when compared to the whole Arch user base.\n* Cultural / Lingual / Selection biases: This survey was only provided in English, to an Arch subreddit largely conducted in English\n* Self reported: We're taking everyone at their word\n* And others... Just know that we aren't claiming perfection here.\n\nBut overall, we think it was taken appropriately, and that the results are accurate and insightful\n\n**Explanation of Method**\n\nIt's important to know that not everyone saw the same set of questions. Those who expressed that they had not yet tried Arch were given a separate section, so as to ask them a more appropriate set of questions. This group was also asked many analogous questions to the main group, so that some comparisons could be drawn.\n\n**Highlights of Results**\n\nHere, I'll direct your attention to a few of the results I found interesting, but in the interest of both digestibility and letting the community draw its own conclusions, I'll keep this on the brief side\n\n* The posts we see don't represent the lingual diversity that's actually present on the subreddit\n   * Only **45.1%** of respondents claim English as their primary language.\n   * And **12.6%** or respondents reported an English proficiency that I would expect encounters communication difficulties at least some of the time.\n* We seem to have a wide, and fairly even distribution of experience. There are more users with relatively short terms of usership, but it does look like people tend to stay with Arch\n* Those who haven not yet tried Arch generally wish to use Arch in the future (**57%**)\n* The most cited reasons for not yet trying Arch are (in descending order)\n   * Setting up Arch involves too much configuration\n   * Stability issues, or concerns about stability issues\n   * The install process itself\n   * Happier with another distribution\n* Gaming compatibility is still a concern for **11.2%** of those who haven't tried Arch yet\n   * On the other hand, **77.6%** of Arch users report gaming as one of the activities they use Arch to do\n* KDE Plasma is by far the favorite graphical environment for both those who use Arch, and those who haven't yet (**36.8%** and **43%** respectively)\n   * Hyprland and Gnome are the silver and bronze medalists\n      * Among Arch users Hyprland has **26.4%** and Gnome has **10.8%**\n      * Among Arch Excluded, Gnome has **21.5%** and Hyprland has **13.2%**\n   * Arch users also have a noticeable affinity for Sway (**4.6%**), i3 (**4.4%**), and xfce (**3.4%**)\n   * COSMIC may be new, but it's already attracted a lot of attention\n      * **17.7%** of respondents report having given it a try\n      * **1.3%** of respondents declared COSMIC as their favorite\n* Kitty and Konsole were neck and neck for the favorite terminal emulator as the results were coming in, but the ultimate favorite was Kitty (**30%**). Konsole finished with **23.5%**, and Alacritty finished with **17.4%**\n   * I didn't expect Foot to be as popular as it was, and I apologize for not including it in the initial prompt. Foot has the hearts of **4.74%** of respondents, making it overall, the 5th most popular.\n\n**Hardware Breakdown**\n\nCPU\n\n|\\-|Intel|AMD|Other|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Arch Users (3798)|41.8%|57.7%|0.34%|\n|Arch Excl (123)|41.5%|55.3%|3.25%|\n\n* Others mentioned include Apple Silicon, ARM, \"I don't Know\", and responses reporting that they have multiple main systems with differing configurations.\n\nGPU\n\n|\\-|Nvidia|AMD-D|AMD-I|Intel-D|Intel-I|Other|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Arch Users (3794)|40%|31.7%|10.1%|1%|15.3%|1.98%|\n|Arch Excl (123)|42.3%|28.5%|8.1%|0|15.4%|5.69%|\n\n* For brevity, \"D\" indicates \"dedicated\", and \"I\" indicates \"integrated\"\n* Others mentioned include \"I don't know\", Apple Silicon, ARM, Hybrid configurations, and responses reporting that they have multiple main systems with differing configurations\n\nRoot Hard Drive\n\n|\\-|M.2 / NVMe|Sata SSD|Sata HDD|External HD|Other|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Arch Users (3768)|77%|17.9%|3.4%|0.5%|1.17%|\n|Arch Excl (0)|n/a|n/a|n/a|n/a|n/a|\n\n* Others mentioned include: Virtual, eMMC, Flash Drive / SD, Floppy Drive, Fusion Drive, and IDE HDD\n\n**Highlights from long form responses**\n\n* There were many long form responses thanking those who develop or contribute to Arch. There were even some saying that I should have mentioned something about donations in the survey\n   * I probably won't include this in a future survey *directly*, but if you're grateful for Arch , and wish to express some of that gratitude, the following link is where you can do so. If you can't, no worries, but if you can, even a small donation is very helpful\n   * Donate: [https://archlinux.org/donate/](https://archlinux.org/donate/)\n* By far, the most common long form response was \"*I use Arch, btw*\"\n   * I too use Arch ... ... ... btw\n* Another common response was those which expressed gratitude for the Wiki\n   * A little looking, a little reading, and a little patience does go a long way!\n* *my answer to \"my preferred way of completing a task\" question, is more like \"depends on how easy or annoying it is on cli/gui\"*\n   * I do apologize for the vague nature of this question. This response was included as an elaboration to that question, and I believe it represents well what the poll results were trying to convey. I'll try to give that question some better direction next time.\n* Some users expressed a want for Arch to support ARM, or for Arch Linux ARM to pick up support\n   * Given the recent direction consumer hardware has started moving, I agree, this would be nice to see\n* Many users wish to tell their past selves to \"*Take your backups!*\"\n   * They walked so we can run!\n\nAnd many, many more... I'll be reading through all these responses for quite a while. (Access to the complete set of long form responses seems to be limited due to volume. This was not set by us, and I will do what I can to make them all available, but I don't yet have an answer)\n\nThere's a lot more to be discovered in the full results. So if you have time, I encourage giving them a look! Please feel free to share your discoveries in the comments.\n\nWith that, this is the conclusion of this survey! I have so much gratitude for all who participated and contributed, so thank you to everyone. I look forward to seeing you all for the next one!\n\nEdit: Appending the [Survey Opening Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1hf7yda/arch_linux_community_survey/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

It was just for fun, 2 years ago i can't imagination how i change my OS from windows to some distributive at linux. 2 weaks ago i go buy new ssd disk for arch, because i want leave my OS at windows at second disk, I need some programs which exists only at windows. Before downloading arch I'm tried use WSL, but it was not good, i dont enjoy it. But moment, when i bought new disk and download my first distro in my life and how i know arch mark as hard distro for new, this was perfect. My first login in system was a good, but one moment. My second monitor have problems, my GHZ was 60 and when I changed, that was 60 GHZ. I had the opportunity to change my GHZ and I click save, but any changes. So, my friends say: \"You have a problems with drivers, fix this\". I go to fix. Maybe I spent one day for fix and right now my second monitor work good, without any problem. When I'm fix, maybe I removed some driver and my second monitor did't work. After i start work with Vs code and i had also some problems, because more extantions don't find if I download vs code from official website, but i can find more extanstions if I download from software store, but I can't use yarn or something else. I find solution just download with yay. It's helped me. \n\nI'm moved to arch beacuse windows have many useless updates, which eat my GB at ssd disk. And system was slow for coding, because many trash was downloaded at my pc, from me and from windows. I'm never like tab with news or more trash from windows. I'm every time clean my disk, because updates have a big size (my ssd 220+gb) and every update take many GB of my memory. With arch i don't have any problems with sizes, I downloaded at my system only things, which i need. I don't see any news every launch, i don't see any updates and crashes. Windows have a good sides also, but arch I liked more then windows. Perhaps not much time for my review, but I think its okay. I use this system just for coding, but this coding became a comfortable at 100%\n\nMaybe someone want also share own road to linux or experience",

I did not understand that I have to put \"root\" on the login, so I was just stumped there and kept reinstalling until I used my head and used google.  \n8.) did not understand that I have to use **sudo nano /etc/locale.conf** and the other instructions that told me to edit something in etc/ folder. I was just there stumped asking why the \"command\" /**etc/locale.conf** is not working  \n9.) did not install bootloader  \n10.) did not install efibootmgr  \n11.) did not install networkmanager or iwd  \n12.) did not search how to cancel a ping so I was stuck there for 30 mins just waiting for ping to end learned that I can just control c by just experimenting.  \n13.) put my country in the part where you /usr/region/city /localtime of something.

Fedora was just overall very buggy in my opinion.\n\nUp to this point I’ve stayed away from arch hearing that it’s impossible to install and use, ran arch install and it was as straight forward as any other distro, set up time shift with btrfs snapshots and installed an LTS kernel (because I’ve heard of arch breaks this will come in handy), as easy as you’d want. No issues, at this point I’m bewildered as I’ve set up a minimal system with literally nothing going wrong, (was also easy af using the arch manual) but then came the games, installed goverlay Mangohud and gamemode, no problem, played a brand new released game (Like a dragon pirate yakuza in Hawaii) fedora had weird audio issues with this game among other issues but on arch, nothing, perfect. \n\nArch was my last ditch effort at Linux after trying 10+ distros and so far it’s been absolutely flawless, the only thing I fear now is an update causing my system to break, but falling back to an LTS kernel or using timeshift should be the solution.\n\nSince I do not tinker around with my Linux systems I hope my arch installation will keep working for the foreseeable future, I’ll barely be using the AUR, all I do is web browsing and gaming and with fedoras freezing and audio issues even that was a pain.

OR if it fails to run mkinitcpio during your update, be sure to fix the config and re-run it or you wont be able to boot. \n\nHere is the forum thread in question:\n\nhttps://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=304822\n\nEDIT 2:\nThis deprecation possibly should have had a corrisponding news item on the Arch homepage to save us from sky is falling claims of broken kernel builds.

I would really like to run it on my Lenovo Slim 7x laptop with the Qualcomm Snapdragon processor. All the major laptop manufacturers are offering laptops with ARM processors. I've had it for 6 months now and it's a great device, the worst part is Windows 11. Qualcomm is just now finally finishing the driver support and it appears to be almost complete with 6.13.\n\nI hope next time, the drivers are complete when the hardware is finished! I've definitely complained on their forums and told them it's idiotic they don't start writing many of the drivers until after they release the hardware!\n\nI know you guys demoted ARM from your installations, but I think you should consider bringing it back. Between Raspberry Pi and these new processors, I think the number of installs would be larger this time.\n\nI know of the Arch Linux Arm effort, but it appears to be just one person. Maybe if Qualcomm sent you guys some hardware? How much would you want?\n\nRegards,\n\n\\-Keith",

My first OS was windows xp, then 7, then windows 8(hated that by the way), used windows 10 and 11.... I have used linux distros too in between like ubuntu and kali Linux in my school days. Didn't really liked ubuntu. I liked kali but went back to windows because games and other things weren't supported properly on Linux. I just found windows better overall. Now, after windows dropped their windows 11 i noticed my laptop got slower and it felt like windows was just trying to monetize everything by showing me ads and useless info. Taskbar was filled with bunch of crap i never used. I saw PewDiePie video of him switching to Linux and thought maybe i should try it too for real and not just dual boot it and then come back to windows and i installed arch on my laptop and used hyprland. It was Fun trying to figure it out. It was kind of silly using terminal to change my brightness, breaking it and reinstalling it again🤣 soon after some time i got some hand of it. Experimented a little with dotfiles then found a project on GitHub called Hyde desktop environment, tried it, liked it, and then just used that till now. It's been more than 5 months now and recently i tried using windows on my friend's laptop and mannnn....it just felt soo slow...like...using mouse to move my cursor and then clicking on apps to open them...yuckkkkkk 🤣🤣 sounds kinda funny but i didn't expect that using arch for some months would make me hate windows soo much...i couldn't believe I used to use that shit for soo long... In uni while all struggle to set up virtual environments for their python project i do it in seconds in my terminal. Everything still doesn't work perfectly out of box on Linux but still the fact that you can just fix it is soo amazing.. and now with all the tools like chatgpt, if you have any problem just copy all the errors from terminal and it'll guide you step by step how to fix it.

None of it was worth it, even though I loved the idea of a declarative distro..

    "body": "I want to make a minecraft server, but not for friends, for a big community. The server will contain multiple java instance (like 4-5), and I want to know if I should use Arch linux for a server.\n\nHere are my pros and my cons:\nPros:\n - I REALLY enjoy and know how to use Arch Linux. I did several arch linux installation, and if I need to choose a PC OS, I'll use arch.\n - I don't want to use Debian server, because it feels a bit old. It seems that debian is very stable, but that it isn't very well updated. I dunno if this is much of an issue, so please tell me.\n - I don't want to use Ubuntu Server, because I don't really like how Ubuntu is. For me, it's really bloated, and I don't like having a bloated server. Maybe it's just me, so again, please tell me your opinion.\n\nCons:\n - Rolling updates: A lot of people doesn't like Arch because each day, there are new updates and you NEED to check your server each day, and make a lot of maintenance for it. I dunno if this is much of a problem, so again, please tell me.\n\nSome people proposed me Void Linux, but again, please tell me your opinion\n\n(EDIT AFTER 30 DAYS)\nOkay so RemindMe bot just reminded me this message.\n\nSo, after 30 days (I guess), I got my server, and it was really good !!!\nI saw on htop less process than Ubuntu Server, but I don't really know if this is better, and if I just didn't make a placebo effect.\nPerformance side, the minecraft server didn't changed much.\nUsability side: I didn't have much of updates to make, once a week it worked well. Because I like arch, it was easier to me to use arch than ubuntu server, but if you like ubuntu server/debian, go for it.\n\nSo, the conclusion: Using arch as a server wasn't much of a difference; You don't really need to check every day for an update, but there isn't a really big performance gap between both.\nUse Arch for server if you know how to use it, and if you're comfortable with arch. Use Ubuntu Server / Debian if you're comfortable with Debian based Linux distros.",

    "body": "So all these lads in my life have always been yapping about how difficult arch is to use and install. So i booked a day of the weekend to migrate my laptop from openSUSE to Arch. Why not? I just finished my exams and i have little better to do before I start my summer job.\n\nIt was just a straight forward install...\n\nSure, you had to mess with some config files and partition some drives. But most of this stuff is things that most people have done before. I anyways needed to mess with the Fstab to mount my Sambashares and make users with different perms so my partner can use my computers without accidentally messing with my system. (or atleast lowering the risk). This stuff that I usually do after the installation, I just got the opportunity to do during the installation. Different, but not more difficult.\n\nThe real thing that I found a bit difficult was getting the boot loader to work. So yah, that did take an hour or so, I must admit. But I would not consider it too painful with the Arch-Wiki literally holding my hand through the entire process.\n\nI do say that I am enjoying Arch so far. I have felt like I needed to wrestle some of the pre-installed software in openSUSE to get my system working like I wanted it too. Which is something I am yet to feel in Arch. But other than that its just a normal working distribution. I have been scammed into thinking it was this super complicated integrates system of machinery lol.\n\nI guess what I am trying to express is that Arch is more mundane than what a lot of people hype it up to be. Which is nice, since what is the use of a distro if you spend more time configuring it than actually being productive with it.",

And so I tried to find alternatives, I found arch. I was a pretty big power user at the time and arch Linux looked perfect, I like my games and Linux gaming through proton has gotten increasingly better. I was about to upgrade my PC anyway so why not experiment? In a call with my friends I said that I’m done with the Microsoft crap and I left the call and immediately went to install arch. And post install it was just as good as I thought it would be, I started with KDE, downloaded all my stuff, transferred files and it all worked perfectly. Then for like a month I dug through the rabbit hole and tried hyprland, then went back to kde, tried dual booting. And yes sometimes the troubleshooting can be annoying but once I got to know my way around the terminal it all worked out perfectly. I can now proudly call myself an arch user!

Thus, after looking for what security things I could do, I went down the Secure Boot on Linux rabbit hole.\n\nAfter a few hours of messing around with shim and getting it working with the default keys, I realised I was still weak and not asserting full dominance over the machine, for this way I was using Microsoft's Secure Boot keys, which made things easier, but, Microsoft, you know? I use Arch btw, I do things my way, I don't want no Microsoft here.\n\nWith newfound energy, I went down the custom Secure Boot keys hole. I updated my BIOS to the latest stable version to have all the fancy features and fixes, and off I went!\n\nThis one far more interesting, for it involved figuring the keys out, which was a lot of fun, generating them, setting up auto-signing of the kernels as pacman hooks... Lots of fun stuff to spend a day doing.\n\nBut the final stretch was truly the most fun - messing with the firmware to get it added as an allowed key in the first place! The part that involves jank because your mobo's manufacturer added the feature in for UEFI compliance and probably never tested it!\n\nAfter ~~slowly losing my mind~~ bashing the keyboard in this one specific way, I figured out the idiosyncrasies Gigabyte wanted me to do to get a custom key enrolled and allowed to boot.\n\nSuccess! I did it! I achieved Security Enlightenment! No more pesky malicious files could ever be booted to possibly log my disk encryption password! All the security! I reboot to behold in admiration all the invisible processes happening to secure all, in my naturally optimised setup with 1 whole whopping second shaved off the regular boot time.\n\nI tremble in anticipation of all the power I am about to assert before this machine, all the security!\n\n---\n\nNo POST. Hmm, that's odd, I only set up Secure Boot with a custom key, no other settings were changed. I reboot again. No POST, nothing. I stare contest the motherboard's pretty lights. Bootlooped after a few seconds, huh. That's most peculiar!\n\nI start disconnecting hardware. Re-plugging cables, checking the power supply. All looking mighty fine. I take out the CMOS battery to reset everything. Nothing. No POST. Only pretty lights for me to stare at. I briefly consider hanging it on the wall as a decoration.\n\nThis is *most* peculiar.\n\n---\n\nI went to RMA the motherboard, thankfully still under warranty, and, surprisingly, it *didn't* magically start working when demonstrating it to the tech! Now that would have been awkward!\n\nA few weeks later I got a new motherboard, unclear whether it was a full replacement or a repair, however. I can henceforth conclude that Gigabyte agreed with me on this being most peculiar and very un-supposed to happen, for otherwise I would have been charged for the fix.\n\nAnd this is how the power of customisability and doing it all my own way has shown me I am powerful enough to brick an entire motherboard by just enrolling an approved key for Secure Boot.\n\n---\n\nI never shared this with anyone in writing, ahah, maybe this silly way of sharing it gets a few laughs out of you.",

Just a blinking cursor in the terminal.  \n\nAfter some googling, I realized I had to install a desktop environment (I chose XFCE).  \nThen I went through choosing which other programs I wanted to install with pacman until I figured out that some packages aren't there and you had to use the Arch User Repository and go through this whole make build process.  \nThen I discovered there was an AUR package to make installing AUR packages easier called `yay` (although I use paru now).  \nI got everything eventually setup into a usable state within few days to a week or so and decided I wanted to try in on my work machine.  \n\nTwo months later I horribly mis-configured something so that my computer was never able to shutdown and always saw some sort of `watchdog` message on repeat.  \n\nFast-forward to now, I am comfortable setting up a new machine with archlinux from scratch and have my dotfiles stored in a repo.  \nI don't need clicky DEs anymore and use `i3` (it's dope).  \nI don't rice too hard, just `picom` and a nice randomized background with `feh`.  \nI escaped VSCode and now neovim as my editor.  \nI also love/depend on `tmux` and miss it most whenever I am back on a Windows machine.  \nI never bothered with a display manager and just enter `startx` to launch i3.  \nIf I fail my password too many times in a sudo command (which happens embarrassingly often) I developed a habit of switching TTYs, logging in as root user and using `faillock` to let me try again.  \n\nAt this point I am still nowhere close to being an expert of archlinux or most things Linux related.  \nBut getting into archlinux helped me learn and grow so much more as a programmer than if I had stayed complacent with Windows and Ubuntu.  \nIt helped me discover my tastes and realize that was even an option on an operating system.  \nIt can look and feel the way I want it to.  \n\nAll that being said, I am feeling pretty cozy and complacent here now though and doubt I will switch to a different OS anytime soon :)",

GNOME has been rock solid for me, and I have discovered it is far more customizable than I gave it credit for\n* **Custom** **4K GRUB themes** → not only functional but also really slick to look at\n\nThe result? Easily the most stable and reliable Arch experience I have ever had. I get the same peace of mind I had on NixOS with rollbacks, without giving up the Arch flexibility I love.\n\nHow do I know I am truly happy with it? The distrohop itch is gone.",

    "title": "My journey from Windows to Arch Linux",
    "body": "After months of trying a bit of Fedora in Virtualbox, I decided to make the switch.\n\n\nI'm not entirely new to Linux, I have experience in using the cli because I needed to ssh to a work server to retrieve or upload files.\n\n\nThe reason why I wanted to move to Linux was because I couldn't stand how Windows throws ads at me everywhere, along with how much of a ram hog it has gotten (Have you seen how much of ram Windows can use on idle?). It also has the issue of forced updates, along with how the OS just \"doesn't work when I want it to\". \n\n\nWell of course it was hard to make the switch still until I saw Pewdiepie's video. Here I thought, \"If a non-tech YouTuber can customise all of that, I can do it too\"\n\n\nSo I decided to backup my important files to another drive, and funnily enough I feel like Windows could sense it's death is coming as explorer.exe when I tried to open the file browser. Worse of all, when I tried to restart it, guess what? Task Manager of all things crashed too. After an hour of trying to wrestle with this system, along with repairing the Windows Installation (Which was corrupted when I checked, and don't worry my disks and ram are fine when I did checks). I backed up my files and decided to move to Linux. \n\n\nNow at this point I was terrified, I've never fully left Windows before, but I thought the first leap is always the hardest. If things break, let it break, I have backups so whatever. \n\n\nThe first distro I went to was Fedora, I got it running but... Oh dear, Nvidia doesn't play nice. I got it up and running but nope, something else breaks. \n\n\nI decided to try another distro, OpenSUSE Tumbleweed. Installed it, it works... Nvidia again. I never managed to get Nvidia working there, and I got the issue where shutting down would lead to seeing blank terminal screen with just an underscore there. \n\n\nI tried to find solutions, but I didn't really have luck. I noticed one pattern however whenever I searched for solutions online. I always see Arch Wiki in the search results of Google. \n\n\"Arch Linux? Isn't that the distro with the hardest installation procedure?\"\n\n\nThe biggest factor that made me want to try is the community and the Arch Linux Wiki.\n\n\nI took the plunge, spent an entire weekend morning trying to install it. The full terminal experience was scary but the Arch Wiki is amazing on guiding through the whole installation.\n\n\nWhen it was finally over, I got everything up and running, Nvidia worked, all my sound drivers and WiFi worked too. \n\n\nI would like to say I appreciate the Arch Wiki, because they have the best documentation of pretty much almost anything on installing Arch Linux and getting it running. I am happy with my new system, I got a taste of freedom. No more ads, no more forced updates. System works when I tell it to work.\n\n\nIs it a beginner distro in my opinion? No. \nIs it good at learning Linux? It's excellent. \nInstalling Arch Linux is pretty much a \"I get it now\" meme moment for me. \n\n\nTo anyone considering to jump to Linux: Back up your files and take the plunge. The first step is the hardest I know but it's worth it. \n\n\nTo anyone considering to try Arch Linux: The hardest part is reading and following instructions, I cannot stress this enough. It's not the cli commands, it's reading that's hard. The world has made it such that our attention spans are pretty much like a goldfish now, and I swear it's somehow making us dumber each day, like there's an agenda to make us dumber on purpose.\n\n\nThank you to the Arch community, you guys are awesome. \n\n\nI can finally say: I use Arch btw\n\nEdit: Typo",

Whenever the RAM usage increases to around 5-7 GB, the system optimizes aggressively, reducing the usage back to 3-5 GB. During this process, the screen occasionally freezes for a few seconds. While I appreciate Arch's minimalism and efficiency, I have 16 GB of RAM and would prefer it to use the available memory rather than optimizing so aggressively that it causes noticeable lags.\n\nMy primary goal with Arch is to deepen my understanding of Linux internals and enjoy a tailored experience—not necessarily to hyper-optimize resource usage at the cost of smooth performance. I also dislike the stereotype that Arch or Linux users are only using old, underpowered machines. Many of us have modern hardware, and it’s important to ensure Linux distributions make full use of it.\n\nI’ve gone through the documentation, but most of the advice I’ve found focuses on reducing RAM and CPU usage—essentially the opposite of my problem.

Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away permanently unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because we love Reddit, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.\n\nThe two-day blackout isn't the goal, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.\n\n**What can you do?**\n\nComplain. Message the mods of /r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit\n\n\n**submit a support request** \n\ncomment in relevant threads on /r/reddit, such as this one, leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.\n\n**Spread the word**. \n\nRabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at /r/ModCoord- but please don't pester mods you don't know by simply spamming their modmail.\n\nBoycott and spread the word...to Reddit's competition! Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite non-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!\n\n**Don't be a jerk**. \n\nAs upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible.\n\n# EDIT:\n\nI have decided, after much thought to keep it at just 48 hours only.

    "body": "I just had the most ridiculous bug I have seen in my 15 years of Linux.  \n\nI was watching a movie in VLC, in fullscreen. It was a first time I've seen this movie. In one scene, the character turned off all lights, and screen went black. In the darkness, someone was talking, fighting, running for ten minutes. I was sitting there wondering at the creativity of the movie director, until I got bored and wanted to stop it. Then I found out that controls don't work. Including Alt-Tab and other system hotkeys. Ctrl-Alt-Esc saved the day. I started the movie again and found out that actually there is a video right after the black moment!\n\nSo, when VLC encounters a total black moment in video, it stops showing the picture forever (while playing sound) and somehow stops hotkeys from DE working. Only X server's hotkeys work. Further testing shows that it happens only on Arch (latest VLC version, I guess), only in KDE, only in fullscreen and only when VDPAU decoder is on and used. It also only happens with digitally made movies because only they can have totally black frames. Home video and analog tapes always have at least some noise. \n\nImagine the bewilderment I was in for the first time! Heh. \n\nP.S. VLC bugtracker refused me in registration, so I am not reporting it. It is a keeper!\n\nP.P.S. VDPAU, I mean VDPAU decoder. The Nvidia one. I always forget those names.",

Of course I hit them with \"I use Arch btw\", and when they asked me as to why I chose that distro, I said \"It's neat and minimalist while also being a bleeding edge distro\", and then they hit me with \"Well we're running Arch on our servers\" – these guys need the latest libraries and things like that, not gonna get into details. Needless to say, I got pretty excited about that prospect and didn't wait to express that.\n\nAfter a couple more questions I was told that they're gonna get back to me in somewhere around a week or so, we said our goodbyes and the interview was over. Then, some 5-10 minutes later I remembered about some aspect of the conditions or something like that, so I went ahead and asked the recruiter about that. Out of the blue, she hits me with: \"We decided that you're a suitable candidate for this position\" and all that. Having a soft skills interview on Monday, but that's more of a formality, pretty much like interviews with recruiters. Never had issues with neither former, nor latter.\n\nSo, what I'm getting at is it looks like what started as my little experiment to see if I'd like Linux more than Windows, turned into genuine passion and with a little bit of additional complementary skills learning – into a decent job, so there's one more reason to love Arch. To say that I feel on top of the world would be an understatement.",

    "body": "So, this is mostly just a thank you to all those selfless folks that put in time to maintain packages, update and maintain the wiki, and all the other things I'm not even smart enough to mention. \n\nIt's been about 10 years since I discovered Linux in general, and only about 3 since I've been familiarizing myself with Arch and the other distros out there. I've absolutely fallen in love with the idea of open source, community-driven knowledge and software. \n\nRecently, I've been dealing with a lot: I'm trying to finish my last 9 credit hours to graduate with my bachelors in CS, I'm married, I have a job lined up for when (... not if) I graduate, and I've been in custodial court for the last 6 years over my daughter. Last night I hit a bit of a wall, and found myself pretty down. Like, couldn't muster the energy to do ANYTHING, down. I'm sure some of you are familiar with that feeling. \n\nI decided I'd give a go of getting Arch installed on my new laptop, alongside Windows. I've done several Arch installs now without hitch, but getting UEFI working with Windows was something I hadn't attempted yet, and definitely made me a little nervous to try. I figured that, if nothing else, I'd be able to distract myself by working on that until I got tired and needed to go to bed. \n\nLo and behold, as is always the case, the Arch Wiki was my Bible. I had it all working successfully within about 2 hours of starting this little mini-quest. Believe it or not, all it took was this small victory to get me out of my slump. I woke up feeling optimistic and a little proud of myself for at the very least being able to RTFM, lol. \n\nSo, thanks again for all your nerds out there that make this kind of thing possible. Thank you for everyone who pours over the Wiki, correcting out-of-date pages and ensuring it maintains good readability. Thank you for helping me remember that there's always tomorrow, and that we can always find inspiration in the most unusual and unexpected ways.\n\nEdit: hey everybody, stop spending your money or whatever on awards! Just dropping a “&lt;3” in the comments can achieve the same effect. Regardless, thank you from the bottom of my heart for the love. It means a lot. If anyone ever needs a stranger to talk to about ANYTHING, be it work, Linux, girls (no promises on my ability to help there, though), depression, or how stupid the two-party political system is, please don’t hesitate to drop me a line.",

    "body": "I've performed a dark ritual experiment in an ***unsupported*** way of running Arch and collected real-world data throughout a one-year period. This is purely for research purposes and should not be blindly followed.\n\nTLDR: Arch has been rock solid and yielded 99.96% availability via unattended updates, and greatly exceeded my expectations.\n\nOne year ago, I created an instance at Oracle Cloud and decided to run Arch Linux on it. It's a minimalist installation of the `base` system, the `linux` kernel, the `grub` bootloader, and a bunch of packages such like VPN service. This instance is for the sole purpose of a VPN server. The total number of packages installed is around 145. I sticked to the default configuration as much as possible to minimise chances of generating `pacnew`.\n\nI was curious what would happen if I do unattended updates and reboot on a daily basis.\n\nContent of `/root/autoupdate.sh`:\n\n    date &gt;&gt; /root/autoupdate.log\n    pacman -Syu --noconfirm &gt;&gt; /root/autoupdate.log 2&gt;&amp;1\n    reboot\n\nContent of `crontab -e`:\n\n    15 20 * * * /root/autoupdate.sh\n\nList of systemd services enabled by me:\n\n    cronie\n    haveged\n    VPN service\n    sshd\n    paccache.timer\n    systemd-networkd\n    systemd-networkd-wait-online\n\nLast year the Arch installation guide still recommended `dhcpcd`. However, this later proved to be problematic for the VPN service to start correctly only after the network is up. I replaced it with `systemd-networkd`, and this has been the only major maintenance ever required throughout the whole year.\n\nI queried the log of the VPN service via `journalctl -u &lt;VPN service name&gt;`. Then I exported the timestamps of the stopping and starting of the VPN service, and worked out that the total downtime has been 2 hours, 53 minutes and 18 seconds throughout the last 327 days (omitted about a month due to log lost to a restoration from a snapshot). This is 99.96% availability.\n\nLuckily my VPS instance never got borked due to a new format of configuration required. List of `pacnew` files found via `cat /var/log/pacman.log | grep pacnew`:\n\n    /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.pacnew\n    /etc/locale.gen.pacnew\n    /etc/systemd/homed.conf.pacnew\n    /etc/default/grub.pacnew\n\nDisk usage has converged to 3.8 GiB while `paccache.timer` keeps the last 3 versions of each package.\n\nConclusion:\n\nWith minimalist installation and minimal customisation, it is possible to let Arch roll unattended without human intervention. Packages from the Core repo has proved to be of high quality. Hopefully this data provides some insight into building high-availability systems with failover relying on Arch unattended.",

We take that away, and that's how we get their attention. \n\nPersonally; I could supplement my needs by reading documentation, using Stack Overflow, Chatgpt, and [archlinux.org](https://archlinux.org) \n\nYou all are great people and I love getting involved. At the same time; there's a socio political battle for the experiences we have on this platform. Civil Disobedience or boycotting is where our power comes from. \n\nThank you all for participating in this discussion. I'd be cool if the mods lock it at this point because we all get the gist. I'm going to drop from reddit until something changes. Or I'm going to try.",

After you added the parameter reboot your laptop.\n\nrun **sudo nano /etc/intel-undervolt.conf**\n\nDecrease the CPU mV by -10 like this.\n\n    undervolt 0 'CPU' -10\n\nSave and exit then run **sudo intel-undervolt apply &amp;&amp; sudo intel-undervolt read** and check it applied properly.\n\nNext stress test for system stability as undervolting can cause a system to crash or hang, run **yay -S mprime**\n\nrun **mprime**\n\nStress test for 30 minutes, then decrease the mV by -10 for every successful run until your laptop crashes or hangs, once you find the sweet spot you can enable the undervolt service run **sudo systemctl enable intel-undervolt.service** make **sure** your system runs stable before enabling this service as it can result in an unbootable or unstable system.\n\n[Arch Wiki page for undervolting](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Undervolting_CPU).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Step 6. Hibernation Suspend and Swap\n\n* Swap makes memory management for your laptop easier,[\\[1\\]](https://haydenjames.io/linux-performance-almost-always-add-swap-space/) [\\[2\\]](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/do-we-really-need-swap-modern-systems) [\\[3\\]](https://chrisdown.name/2018/01/02/in-defence-of-swap.html) if you're worried about SSD writes I'll show you how to reduce swappiness or turn off swapping (not recommended) so you can use swap for just hibernation.\n* For hibernation to work you **need** a swap, I'll show you how to enable hibernation for a swap partition and leave the swap file [Arch Wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate#Hibernation_into_swap_file).\n* People using LVM2 I left a separate guide as it's slightly different.\n* Swap files on btrfs are also different I'll leave the [Arch Wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate#Hibernation_into_swap_file_on_Btrfs).\n* Suspend should work without configuring anything, I'll show you how to fix it if it doesn't work properly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo enable hibernation run **sudo blkid** and grab the swap partitions **\"UUID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"**\n\nNext add **resume=UUID=xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx** as a kernel parameter to your boot loader here is the [Arch Wiki page for adding kernel parameters to yours](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/kernel_parameters).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**For LVM2** users run **sudo lsblk** and check where the swap partition is located.\n\nNext add **resume=/dev/YourVolumeGroup/yourLogicalVolume** as a kernel parameter to your boot loader here is the [Arch Wiki page for adding kernel parameters to yours](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/kernel_parameters).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext configure the initramfs I'll copy and paste how to configure it from the Arch Wiki since it does a better job at explaining than I can.\n\nrun **sudo nano /etc/mkinitcpio.conf**\n\n* From Arch Wiki **\"When an initramfs with the base hook is used, which is the default, the resume hook is required in /etc/mkinitcpio.conf.

Wireless Card Power saving\n\n* From Arch Wiki **\"these power saving options are experimental and can cause an unstable system.\"**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nrun **lsmod | grep '\\^iwl.vm'** and make a note of the result.\n\nrun **sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf**\n\nadd **options iwlwifi power\\_save=1**\n\nadd **options iwlmvm power\\_scheme=3** or **options iwldvm force\\_cam=0**  |  depending on the lsmod result\n\n[Arch Wiki page for wireless card power saving](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management#Intel_wireless_cards_(iwlwifi)).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Step 12. Power Management Script\n\n* You can have an easier time by running **sudo pacman -S powertop**. I'll leave the [Arch Wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/powertop).\n* What I did is make a script to apply the same optimizations PowerTop does but I added more that PowerTop doesn't.\n* **DO NOT BLINDLY COPY AND PASTE THIS, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nrun **sudo nano /usr/bin/Power\\_Management** then see what you need from the lines (yes you do need the \"#!/bin/sh\" part) below and please keep in mind **the lines below are for my laptop specifically** so you'll need to edit it to make it specific for your laptop, which shouldn't hard and if you don't need to enable some stuff in this script like *\"echo XHC &gt; /proc/acpi/wakeup\"* don't. Not all laptops are the same and you should check what you need to and don't need to enable.\n\n    #!/bin/sh\n    echo XHC &gt; /proc/acpi/wakeup\n    \n    echo enabled | tee /sys/bus/usb/devices/{1-7,1-8,usb1,usb2}/power/wakeup\n    \n    echo auto &gt; /sys/block/sda/device/power/control \n    \n    echo powersave &gt; /sys/module/pcie_aspm/parameters/policy\n    \n    echo auto | tee /sys/bus/i2c/devices/{i2c-0,i2c-1,i2c-2}/device/power/control\n    \n    echo auto | tee /sys/bus/pci/devices/{0000:00:00.0,0000:00:1f.0,0000:01:00.0,0000:00:13.0,0000:02:00.0,0000:00:17.0}/power/control\n\nExit and save.\n\n* If your desktop environment supports CPU power management you can skip this part and move on to the chmod command below, only do this part if your desktop environment doesn't support CPU power management, keep in mind this can reduce performance. This part is going to be for the intel\\_pstate driver only and my CPU specifically, I'll link the [Arch Wiki page for other drivers and CPU's](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/CPU_frequency_scaling) so you can edit this script for your CPU and driver.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nrun **cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy\\*/scaling\\_available\\_governors** and make a note of the results.\n\nrun **cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy\\*/energy\\_performance\\_available\\_preferences** and make a note of the results.\n\nAdd the lines you need into the #!/bin/sh script above, If you notice your laptop is slow or stuttering after this put the power profile up till it's not.\n\n    echo \"your choice here\" | tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/{policy0,policy1,policy2,policy3}/scaling_governor\n    \n    echo \"your choice here\" | tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/{policy0,policy1,policy2,policy3}/energy_performance_preference\n    \n    echo 1 &gt; /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo | (This disables the turbo boost feature)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter you finished making your script run **sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/Power\\_Management**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext make a systemd service that runs the script on boot so it's permanent, run **sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/Power\\_Management.service** then copy and paste this in.\n\n    [Unit]\n    Description=Enables Laptop Optimizations\n    \n    [Service]\n    Type=oneshot\n    ExecStart=/usr/bin/Power_Management\n    \n    [Install]\n    WantedBy=sysinit.target\n\nrun **sudo systemctl enable --now Power\\_Management.service &amp;&amp; sudo systemctl status Power\\_Management.service**\n\n(For SATA drives only). run **cat /sys/class/scsi\\_host/host\\*/link\\_power\\_management\\_policy** if the result isn't \"med\\_power\\_with\\_dipm\" here is the [Arch Wiki page to changing it](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management#SATA_Active_Link_Power_Management). (You can probably edit it into the script).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Step 13. Improving performance\n\n* See these pages I won't write any guide since this is laptop specific.\n\n[Improving Performance](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/improving_performance)\n\nIf you have an SSD the [Arch Wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Solid_state_drive).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Step 14. CPU microcode\n\n* From Arch Wiki **\"Processor manufacturers release stability and security updates to the processor** [**microcode**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcode)**. These updates provide bug fixes that can be critical to the stability of your system. Without them, you may experience spurious crashes or unexpected system halts that can be difficult to track down.\"**\n* AMD or Intel CPU users should install microcode for their CPU.\n\n[Arch Wiki page for microcode](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Microcode).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Step 15.

Equipped with a 10th-gen i9, an RTX 3090 and 64GB of RAM (32 shared with the GPU and 32 host only).\nThe collegues were struggling in trying to install Linux.\n\"Maybe there's something wrong with the GPU\", they said. Probably the drivers weren't up to date, who knows. They tried CentOS, RedHat and Ubuntu, none of the bootables were able to show a video output.\nI was like \"Maybe we can try Arch?\"\n\n\"What is Arch?\"\n\"No we're not such nerds\"\n\"No Ubuntu is the best distro, if Ubuntu can't start not even Arch could\" (and this last one was partially true with the original bootable)\nTo install Linux was actually a strong requirement because the products we're developing need a native linux ecosystem and Windows is not a viable option, but it was the only way to boot that computer.\n\nOther two days passed, and no progress was made.\nIn the meantime, I just added nvidia to packages.x86_64 and run secretely a mkarchiso on my stick.\nWaited for the right moment...\n\nAnd the day after, some of them had a meeting long enough to make me start the bootable, wipe out Windows and pacstrap a minimal KDE installation. They came out of the meeting room discussing \"some viable options to start such a new machine\", headed to the computer.\n\nAnd then silence, followed by a \"WTF?\"\n\nToday another computer (a smaller one) arrived and they asked me to install Arch on it.\n\nMany thanks to Arch and the Wiki maintainers!",

Even though pacman keeps track of this information, it doesn't show it by default.\n\nThis can happen because of \n\n* using `pacman -R` instead of `pacman -Rs` to remove packages (dependencies stay installed)\n* makedeps stay installed after building AUR packages\n* packages removing dependencies in newer versions (without you noticing)\n\nYou can remove them by doing `pacman -Qtdq | pacman -Rns -` but check the list carefully first since  some of those packages you might actually want to keep, especially if your installation is very old.\n\nI've added all this info to the [Pacman tips: Removing unused packages](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman/Tips_and_tricks#Removing_unused_packages_\\(orphans\\)) section of the Wiki. \n\nI've also created [pacman-log-orphans-hook^[AUR]](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pacman-log-orphans-hook) which logs the list of unused packages whenever pacman runs.",

When at work, I plug it into an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse. On the same power strip as my charging cable, there is a small refrigerator. \n\nRecently, I have noticed that my mouse cursor disappears intermittently. It is still \"there\" but I can't see it. This only happens to the external mouse; when I move the trackpoint the cursor reappears. But I noticed that the disappearances were not random.

Originally meant to be a rewrite of yay, it's bound to be familiar to people of have used yay or other pacman wrapping AUR helpers.\n\nParu has seen a good amount of popularity and so far there's been 30 other contributors which I'm happy to see.\n\nThere's also been good amount of new features since the initial release. The notable ones being:\n\n- Print PKGBUILD\n- Print AUR comments\n- Print news on upgrade\n- Local repo and chroot support\n- Support for signing packages\n- Syntax highlighting with bat\n- Support for doas with `Sudo = doas` and `SudoLoop = true`\n\nI consider paru mostly feature complete at this point. The only things on my roadmap are [localization](https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru/discussions/424) and 32 bit binaries. Feel free to add to the discussion.\n\nI've also decided to set up [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Morganamilo) with some goals to see what people think and see if that goes anywhere. 5 poeple have already sponsored me so a big thank you to them.\n\nFor those interested in doing pacman/AUR things in rust. Paru is actually made up of several [libraries](https://crates.io/users/Morganamilo) which are in use in by a handful of other projects.\n\nThis includes official [rust libalpm bindings](https://github.com/archlinux/alpm.rs) for those who want to hack around with libalpm. There's also stuff for reading pacman.conf, srcinfo files, querying the AUR, downloading pkgbuilds, and dependency solving\n\nAlso friendly reminder that yes yay is still maintained.

    "title": "Is Arch Linux hitting the mainstream?",
    "body": "So I've noticed that in the past \\~2 weeks two major companies have announced their utilisation of Arch Linux *(for purposes specifically related to gaming)*.\n\nThe more famous announcement was *Valve* announcing the *Steam Deck*. As many on this forum might know, the *Steam Deck* will be using Arch Linux as the base for their own Linux distribution, SteamOS, with the intention to get *every single* Windows video game on Steam working on SteamOS via *(presumably)*, Proton. This news in it of itself is quite exciting as it has the potential of further legitimising the usage of Linux distributions for playing video games hopefully encouraging developers to pay closer attention to it.\n\nThe other, *and in my opinion more interesting*, announcement was by Nvidia. [https://youtu.be/VBfci5hYN1c](https://youtu.be/VBfci5hYN1c) They made a tech demo / showcase where a MediaTek ARM CPU was being used alongside an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti to play the game Wolfenstein: YoungBlood *(an x86\\_64 Windows game)* on Arch Linux (*on an ARM CPU!!)*. You can tell it's Arch Linux from the neofetch output. This was very interesting to me. I am presuming that Nvidia compiled their own version of Arch Linux from the source code on ARM although they might've been using the Arch Linux ARM Project. This means that they, firstly, translated the game's Windows API calls to things Linux can understand (presumably through Proton or Wine or something else) and secondly, the took a game that was designed for the x86\\_64 architecture and got it running on an ARM CPU. They also managed to get an Nvidia GPU running with an ARM CPU so this means they have PCI-E and potentially UEFI? *Sidenote: Nvidia's demo was meant to explore the capabilities of using RTX Chromebooks with ARM CPUs.*\n\nThis is quite interesting indeed and I don't doubt that both companies chose to use Arch Linux due to its flexibility as an OS platform with being very customisable and having the ability to be tailored to one's requirements.\n\nWhat are your opinions on this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: What I'm seeing in the comments has led me to believe that pure Arch *(given as is by the maintainers and the download .iso on* [*archlinux.org*](https://archlinux.org)*)* might not be the one hitting mainstream, but many entities will be basing their own distro's off of Arch due to its modularity and ease of compilation / customisation. \n\nI also forgot to mention *yet another* implementation of Arch Linux, especially on ARM, the *Asahi Linux Project* which aims to get Linux up and running on Apple M1 (ARM) MacBooks claims to be using Arch Linux as the base for their distro. Now sure, it's not being backed by some large company *(probably the opposite, in fact)*, but it's also an interesting use case that further emphasises the preference of developers to use Arch Linux as the base for *\"niche\"* distro use-cases.",

    "body": "I've become a systemadmin for my roommates. They also happen to be my family members. We all moved to the states together about 10 years ago. It's a huge family and we are super tight. We occupy a floor here in this apartment building. Imagine the Home Alone family just instead of a big house it's a bunch of apartments lol.\n\nAnyway. Many of us are PC gamers, particularly the 20-30 year old generation of cousins. (My aunt and uncle had 10 children.) While I'm not exactly going to say I am a tech aficionado I'm sort of known as the \"computer\" guy, I have an IT degree (although I've never put it to real use) and I have a reputation for fixing pleb problems on my friends/family's laptops and PCs. It is usually something simple like installing Windows for them in a very \"clean\" manner, a hardware thing, or just to look for a workaround for a bug. I use Linux myself simply out of personal reasons, it's been a longtime interest of mine.\n\nThe hefty majority of use AMD computers. It wasn't until very recently that the Linux lightbulb went off  for everyone else besides me. It wasn't even to fix an issue or for any specific benefits, just an interest thing, it has quickly become part of our lives honestly. It's been happening for a while but what started really kicking things off recently was I was the only one in this age-group of my family to get access to the new Counter Strike 2 limited beta. With a small crowd of my family around me showing off Counter Strike 2, my brother remarked on how insane it was that the OS I was using to play it wasn't on Windows. That one remark snowballed. I said \"Yeah right?? It's as simple as this\" and then I opened up Steam and showed the \"Steam Play\" sections of the settings menu. \"It comes built right into Steam for Linux, it's called Proton. It pretty much can play any Windows game, besides a very small handful.\" This blew my brother's mind and became a huge talking point. He began pestering me in the most wonderful ways \"Can Linux do this\" \"Will I still be able to keep that\" pondering things and soon enough we all began talking about distros, where Arch comes in. I explained to them the difference between rolling distros and LTS/stable ones. He wasn't interested in distro/OS that \"got a new version every months or year\" I said that a rolling release gives you the benefit of a system that you install once and update forever, at the expense of having to \"stay on top of updates\", ie system maintenance. I said that this isn't really something you can just explain or learn in one sitting, it takes familiarity and experience. But it isn't \"hard\", it's as simple as the idea of being aware of what's on your system. This part went in one ear, right out the other for him 😂 We looked over at the elephant in the room, which is a nearly 7 year old Arch Linux installation on my PC, and then back at eachother. \".....yo why don't you just do it\"\n\nSo there goes my brother, now a happy Arch Linux Plasma desktop user with his newly riced out panel scheme he is obsessed with (I told him not to change too many defaults but he just kept on going lol) it was so nice and surreal to see that obsession on someone else in my family, that I'm not the only one who gets the tingles from seeing OSs that aren't Mac or Windows. He opted for KDE Plasma because of the mix of familiarity, and instant access to Freesync support for his monitor, and the sheer amount of customization. I personally use GNOME but I know that's quite a bold interface I wouldn't try to push it onto someone who doesn't seem interested. The rest of my family began to follow suit, Arch Linux and KDE and Proton became the main talking point of 2023.\n\nSara's bluetooth headphones were literally the only issue and it was because they were some weird knockoff brand from overseas. Everything else works out the box, for everyone. I swear to god I'm not exaggerating, it has been SIGNIFICANTLY less stressful to be the \"little bug fixer computer dude\" in the family, since I switched us all to Linux. I AM THE ONLY GNOME USER, EVERYONE ELSE PREFERRED PLASMA. I think that's hilarious but it is what it is lol. Friday is now update day, I go to 3 different apartments and update all the Arch installations for my family. I want to make a movie out of this or something, life is fucking awesome. The only one who hasn't boarded this bizarre penguin train is my cousin DJ. He simply doesn't want to change anything, the tried &amp; true aint-broke-don't-fix-it type. He'll come around 😎🐧",

    "body": "tl;dr: In PKGBUILD, remove `--user root` and use `chown -R root:root \"${pkgdir}\"` instead.\n\nI found that some nodejs packages were conflicting with each other months ago, but I didn't look into it and just went with `npm install -g` instead of AUR.\n\nYesterday, I met the conflict again and decided to have a look. When I saw `/usr/lib/node_modules/root/tests/index.js`, my first thought was \"oh, the tests are installed in a top-level directory shared among all nodejs packages, so they conflict\". But I soon found myself wrong: how could there be so many packages that don't conflict with each other, if they are all installed in the same directory?\n\nThen, I noticed `/usr/lib/node_modules/root/package.json`. Oops, it's [a package called \"root\"](https://www.npmjs.com/package/root). In the PKGBUILD, there was an \"option\" `--user root`, which seems to be an alternative for `chown -R root:root \"${pkgdir}\"`. But, npm doesn't accept this option [since npm v7](https://github.com/npm/cli/blame/5ae068ae57d309b2ab4bc3f34c27cd1d86bcd7b2/CHANGELOG.md#L2885). Believe it or not, npm doesn't complain about any option that it doesn't recognize. So, `--user root` does nothing but installing the package called root.\n\nThere must be many invalid packages, I thought. But guessing is useless, so I created a new directory and ran `paru -G $(paru -Ssq --aur nodejs-)`. There were 356 such packages, and 184 of them contain `--user root` in the PKGBUILD. What's more, 291 of them don't contain `chown`.\n\nAt first, I commented under many packages. But there were too many. And this somehow seems like spamming. Then I decided to adopt orphaned packages. I only chose the packages that have at least one vote and the upstream is not deprecated or unmaintained for years. The result is the title, and more details are in [my AUR repository](https://github.com/ouuan/AUR-packages).",

I'm 100% sure the password was right, after like 30 min trying to understand what was going on, it magically worked again. Anyway I just didn't care, didn't tried to see what was source of the problem and moved on.\n\nBut today it happened again, not once but twice. Same behavior again, it just doesn't accept the password, and after like 10 min it magically accepts the password again. \n\nThe only output I get is `Sorry try again`. And checking the `journalctl` I found this:\n```\npam_unix(sudo:auth): conversation failed\npam_unix(sudo:auth): auth could not identify password for [myuser]\n```\n\nThat's what `jounarlctl` shows when using sudo doesn't work. Trying to debug this I typed the password wrong on purpose to see what does `journalctl` shows. And when the password is typed wrong I get this: \n```\nmyuser : 1 incorrect password attempt ; TTY=pts/2 ; PWD=/home/myuser ; USER=root\n```\n\nAs you can see, the error message is different. It also confirms that I'm not typing my password wrong (I already was 100% sure of this).\n\nWhile I was writing this post I decided to check `journalctl` a little bit more in detail, looking for key words like *password* and *pam*. And soon enough I found hundreds of lines with the following:\n```\npam_unix(su:session): session closed for user root\n```\n\nBut also, I found just a few a lines with the same, but starting with CROND:\n\n```\nCROND[18486]: pam_unix(crond:session): session closed for user root\n```\nIn these lines the error was comming from the crond service. Long story short, the whole problem was crond failing to execute a command as root for a script I had, which caused the pam module to kick in and block sudo access everywhere for the default fail timeout period. \n\nFirst I was writing this to ask for help, but solved the problem in the middle and since I already had almost the whole post I decided to change it from asking for help, to giving an advice. Specially for new users, which I see a lot of them comming in lately. Remember! always check jurnalctl when weird things start happening, It is amazing to debug problems.",

One of the questions that he asked was what DE environment am I using. Am I using a tiling manager or just windows-like WM. To which I answered that I don't use a tiling manager, stock KDE is fine for me. To which he replied what's the point of using Arch if you aren't using a tiling manager, stick to windows.\n\nThis statement felt very weird and dumb to me coz is he really trying to justify his usage of Arch by a WM which can be configured on any Linux Distro? There are many reasons for using Arch but tiling manager is not one of them lmao.\n\nTo the curious ones, I don't use a tiling manager because my laptop screen is only 14\" and it doesn't make sense to use a tiling manager for such a small display (for larger displays it make sense), at least according to me.\n\nAnd yeah, I didn't have time to make him understand this coz he was in a hurry.\n\n\nEdit: Ok, I was wrong, it does make sense for a tiling manager to be used on smaller display. I just never gave it much thought as I was fine with stock-KDE plasma and I didn't like dividing my display into smaller windows. (Max I like to do is use 2 application in split mode)",

    "body": "Since I've seen people [still discussing this](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/x8h9y7/is_grub_fixed/), [mods denying](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/x8h9y7/comment/inkgmgd/) the [clear upstream bug](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2022-08/msg00374.html), and even people confused in the [arch bug report](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/75701). I've the decided to explain the problem in the best way I know how: with code.\n\nSo we have a menu:\n\n    menuentry \"1. Arch Linux\"\n    menuentry \"2. UEFI Firmware Settings\"\n\nIf we select `1` we start Arch Linux, if we select `2` we enter the UEFI firmware. The command that starts the firmware is called `fwsetup`.\n\n    case $option in\n    \t1) arch ;;\n    \t2) fwsetup ;;\n    esac\n\nNow, this works, but the second menu entry is only generated in machines with UEFI UI support which happened to have booted into UEFI mode (as opposed to legacy BIOS mode) and in August 17 GRUB developers thought it wise to always generate the menu entry regardless of how you booted when you generated the menu: [Improve logic to check for fwsetup support](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2022-08/msg00169.html).\n\nThis has the problem that if UEFI UI is not supported, the menu entry will be displayed, but it will throw an error. So somebody had the idea to decide whether or not to display the menu entry at runtime, by adding an option to `fwsetup` which already has to check for UEFI UI support anyway (to throw the error), so instead of this:\n\n    fwsetup() {\n    \techo \"Starting UEFI firmware\"\n    \techo \"REBOOTING\" &gt;&amp;2\n    \texit\n    }\n\nWe have this:\n\n    fwsetup() {\n    \tif [[ \"$1\" = --is-supported ]]; then\n    \t\ttest -n \"$efi_ui_supported\"\n    \t\treturn $?\n    \tfi\n    \n    \tif [[ -z \"$efi_ui_supported\" ]]; then\n    \t\techo \"ERROR: EFI UI not supported\" &gt;&amp;2\n    \t\treturn 1\n    \tfi\n    \n    \techo \"Starting UEFI firmware UI\"\n    \techo \"REBOOTING\" &gt;&amp;2\n    \texit\n    }\n\nNow the menus are like:\n\n    menuentry \"1. Arch Linux\"\n    \n    fwsetup --is-supported &amp;&amp;\n    menuentry \"2. UEFI Firmware Settings\"\n\nOn machines with UEFI UI support, two entries will be shown, and otherwise just one.\n\nGreat... **If** you run `grub-install` which updates the `fwsetup` command and `grub-mkconfig` which regenerates the menu.\n\nBut what happens if you only do `grub-mkconfig`? (which is run automatically in many Arch-based distros), well then your menu is going to call `fwsetup --is-supported`, which doesn't have that option, so it's going to do:\n\n    fwsetup() {\n    \techo \"Starting UEFI firmware UI\"\n    \techo \"REBOOTING\" &gt;&amp;2\n    \texit\n    }\n\nSo... While trying to display the menu GRUB is going to reboot to start the UEFI firmware UI.\n\nThis is a **BUG**. Upstream has already [acknowledged so](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2022-08/msg00374.html) and are thinking on removing the call to `fwsetup --is-supported` in the menu.\n\nBut it has not yet been fixed in upstream: [30\\_uefi-firmware.in](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/grub.git/tree/util/grub.d/30_uefi-firmware.in) is still calling `fwsetup --is-supported`, and it's not fixed in Arch Linux either. All Arch Linux maintainers did was add a note saying people need to make sure to run `grub-install`, but what if you don't read that?\n\nThe proper fix is to **revert** these changes and return to a version of [30\\_uefi-firmware.in](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/grub.git/tree/util/grub.d/30_uefi-firmware.in?id=46d76f8fef7663b60d025cd425b348029c296350) which is known to work, so before 2022-08-18. In this version `fwsetup` is only called if you select the menu entry, never otherwise.\n\nI've sent a patch to Arch Linux maintainers in yet another bug report: [FS#75862 - \\[grub\\] revert upstream bug which causes GRUB to reboot](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/75862). This way it's not necessary to call `grub-install` to make sure your system boots.\n\n**Update**: My task was closed immediately because according to Arch Linux maintainers it's a \"duplicate\" of task [FS#75701](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/75701): it's not. That task was \"fixed\" by adding a note to run `grub-install`, my task is about fixing the package properly by not requiring to run `grub-install` and thus be backwards-compatible.\n\n**Note**: There are two deviations. one in the case your UEFI doesn't have a UI, in that case if you have an old version of GRUB installed in your EFI partition, `fwsetup`  is not available and GRUB will not attempt to restart to display a non-existent UEFI firmware UI, you'll simply not see the menu entry (presumably). The second one is that if you are on a BIOS platform, I don't know what happens if you run `fwsetup` there, but I've heard that the system crashes (instead of rebooting). I also don't know what happens if you run `fwsetup --is-supported` in BIOS, even if you do `grub-install` you might have problems, another patch to avoid that [has been proposed](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2022-08/msg00384.html).\n\nHere's the full script if you want to simulate what GRUB does in different interactions:\n\n    efi_ui_supported=1\n    \n    menuentry() {\n    \techo \"$1\"\n    }\n    \n    fwsetup_1() {\n    \techo \"Starting UEFI firmware UI\"\n    \techo \"REBOOTING\" &gt;&amp;2\n    \texit\n    }\n    \n    fwsetup_2() {\n    \tif [[ \"$1\" = --is-supported ]]; then\n    \t\ttest -n \"$efi_ui_supported\"\n    \t\treturn $?\n    \tfi\n    \n    \tif [[ -z \"$efi_ui_supported\" ]]; then\n    \t\techo \"ERROR: EFI UI not supported\" &gt;&amp;2\n    \t\treturn 1\n    \tfi\n    \n    \techo \"Starting UEFI firmware UI\"\n    \techo \"REBOOTING\" &gt;&amp;2\n    \texit\n    }\n    \n    fwsetup() {\n    \tfwsetup_1 \"$@\"\n    }\n    \n    arch() {\n    \techo \"Starting Arch Linux\"\n    }\n    \n    menuentry \"1. Arch Linux\"\n    \n    fwsetup --is-supported &amp;&amp;\n    menuentry \"2. UEFI Firmware Settings\"\n    \n    echo -n \"Select one: \"\n    read -r -n1 option\n    echo\n    \n    case $option in\n    \t1) arch ;;\n    \t2) fwsetup ;;\n    esac",

    "body": "I've been using M$ Windows for more than two decades. However, the user experience just got worse and worse over it's iterations, and the creepy telemetry built in Windows 10 is the dealbreaker for me. I decided once and for all to leave the DARK SIDE, and join the rank of happy penguins.\n\nThis is not my first time installing Linux. I've tried several distroes over the past decades, just out of curiosity. Ubuntu, Fedora, and openSUSE are the ones that I've tried with good CJK language support. I also tried Manjaro and MXLinux, but their CJK input method support is not functionally complete, and this is a no-go for me, as I'm Asian. Anyway, I've never used any of them long enough to replace my workflow on M$ Windows. And my skill in Linux command line was near to none, just a noob.\n\nThis time, it's for real. Initially I wanted to try using Fedora Linux for an extended period to get myself acclimated to the Linux DE, command line and workflow, as Fedora was the distro that's a little bit harder than Ubuntu, but not scarily hard. However, I have three hard drives and one SSD installed in my desktop PC, and I'd like to use three HDDs as a single LV (it wasn't too bad to use them separately under Windows as different drives). During installation, I found that there is no easy way to install the EFI and /root on the SSD, while setup a LV comprised of three HDDs and mount it correctly in Fedora's GUI installer. I found little information on this for Fedora during googling, but I found a lot of information and tutorial for Arch Linux.\n\nI've heard that Arch is an \"advanced\" distro, and thus never considered it as an option in the past. But since there are so many documents on Arch website and video tutorials on Youtube, I decided to give it a try. It surely was a little bit scary to see an black prompt rather than colorful graphical installer, but I tried to follow the documents and tutorials relevant to my scenario. So, a noob is installing Arch. Ouch! \n\nThe first installation was successful. I didn't bother try to build a LV, just installed it on a single SSD, with the simplest partition scheme and GRUB as bootloader. Just copy every step from YT tutorial videos, it's totally doable. Then I tried to use btrfs but not ext4 for root partition, and also created a LV and mounted it during installation. I was able to boot it with GRUB, but I made the swap partition too large, 8G for a system with 32G RAM, which makes no sense (of course, I reached that conclusion by more reading and watching more video tutorials.) I was a little too confident at that moment, tried another new installation with swapfile on btrfs. O boy, that was laborious and I didn't set up systemd-boot correctly, thus a total failure. GRUB was able to recognize the efi, but still hanged some point during systemd. For the fourth time, I did a btrfs install with no swap, created a LVM and mounted it, and using systemd-boot as bootloader. The fourth installation was a mixed-bag. I installed two kernels, 5.10 LTS and 5.11. I can boot with 5.10 LTS kernel and install desktop environment, but not with 5.11. 5.11 hangs during systemd, prompted me an error message of not being able to initialize LV and not being able to mount it to its mount point, then goes into emergency shell.\n\nAt this point, I've typed more commands in four days than the past two decades combined. Although I still can't figure out what is the reason that 5.10LTS kernel boots but 5.11 doesn't, but I think I'll just settle down for now as I'm too tired for another round of installation, and start using Arch Linux as my daily driver. Manually generate locale also provide CJK language input support on par with Fedora/Ubuntu/openSUSE, the three distroes with respective commercial versions. Perfect CJK support is the prerequisite of a working machine for me, and Arch delivers, since locale is generated during manual installation.\n\nOver the past two decades, I hardly learned anything of Linux from limited exposure of distroes wrapped under GUI. But just installing Arch Linux four times, at least I learned how to set up a reasonable partition scheme using command line, and gained some knowledge of what was happening under the hood of calamares.\n\nFrom this experience, I think the fastest way for a newcomer to learn the basics of Linux is simply start right away from installing Arch Linux on a simple machine with only one single SSD, but not from using \"beginner friendly\" distroes. If I could complete the same task without changing my habit from using Windows GUI for so long, I won't change that habit under Ubuntu/Manjaro.\n\nI hope the next update of kernel could magically fix the problem of dead hang during systemd init. But 5.10 LTS is doing fine for now, and that's enough for me.",

It's apparently [fixed](https://github.com/sddm/sddm/issues/1471#issuecomment-1483814271) in the [`sddm-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sddm-git) package, but `sddm` proper hasn't had a release since November 2020.\n\nNate Graham just [announced](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/issues/91) that SDDM was approved to become part of the KDE brand in Plasma 6. Hopefully this means more regular releases with more bugfixes!\n\n    [Approved] Plasma 6 Proposal: incubate SDDM\n    \n    Being a non-KDE project necessarily imposes more distance and loses certain opportunities for tighter integration, like the kind that GNOME has with their GDM login manager. It would be of long-term benefit to tighten integration between SDDM and Plasma to improve the UX in a way that incubation within KDE could achieve.\n    \n    At this point nearly all SDDM development comes from KDE devs anyway, so it's already sort of de facto incubated in all but name and release schedule. On that subject, being a part of presumably the Plasma release cycle would also ensure that SDDM gets regular releases, which it is desperately in need of.\n    \n    Obviously we would need to talk with the prior maintainer Pier Luigi Fiorini about this.",

    "body": "So first of all, I'm an idiot. I unironically bought a new Macbook Pro in 2017. I know, I know. I should have known better. In 2015 I daily drove Ubuntu on an old Dell laptop and that experience was less than pleasant. I walked away thinking, \"I'll keep my Ubuntu servers, but the desktop is just too much of a headache.\"\n\nFast foward to 2018. I get a once in a lifetime chance to visit a foreign country with my dad. No way I'm bringing a $2500 laptop with me, so I bought one of the 2011 Lenovo no HDD specials on eBay, threw a SSD in there, and installed Pop!_OS. Sure as hell wasn't going to run Windows.\n\nAfter we checked into a hotel, my dad asked to use the laptop to check his emails, the news, etc. He commented how nice the computer was, \"Where did you get this?\" Lol. I had to agree, it was really nice to use, and even though it was 1/10th the price of my Fruit-adjacent laptop, when I took it home, I started using it more than the other, and I thought to myself, \n\n\"I'll never buy another Mac or Windows PC again, it'll be something Linux based. I need to incrementally change my workflow now so that when that day comes, I'm ready to switch full time.\"\n\nAs nice as Pop!_OS was at the time, I thought it was important to expand my understanding of what was available, so I started distro hopping. Initially, I kept hearing people on Reddit and on various forums talk about how much they loved XFCE, so I started there with Xubuntu. I tried Mint, Ubuntu MATE, Deepin, and a few more, and started to notice everything was Ubuntu based. At the time, the other talked-up and popular distro was Manjaro, and when I tried that, everything changed for me. I had the choice between 3 different Desktop Environments out of the box. It was easy to set up graphics drivers, and change the kernel. Something about pacman I liked a lot more than apt. \n\nHere comes this year. I have 6 children and all told, 3 desktops and 3 laptops that run on Manjaro for our family to use for school and to game together. To some degree, I'm a bona-fide Manjaro fanboy at this point. But, as time went on, I started to notice some disadvantages to it, and the additional overhead of having everything done for you, which is of course a big pro in a lot of ways, but also meant all the systems came with a lot of extra configuration just to brand it as Manjaro and give it the \"Manjaro\" experience. I was longing for a more \"stock\" Arch experience, but doubted my own abilities.\n\nWell, about a year later, I gave it a try, just followed the installation guide, and darn if plain old Arch doesn't run even better than the Manjaro machines, the other nice thing was only dealing with things I had explicitly installed myself, which made configuration and debugging way easier.\n\nSo, I shouldn't have doubted myself. And, I shouldn't have doubted you either, Arch.",

Like many, I started my Linux journey with Ubuntu (version 7.10 \"Gutsy Gibbon\" - feels like a lifetime ago) and I stayed in the Debian family for many years, mostly on Linux Mint. I did distro hop and even go back to Windows for a while but always came back to the familiar ecosystem centered on dpkg and apt/apt-get/aptitude. It was only last year that I changed my daily driver to Manjaro, then EndeavourOS, and finally Arch Linux itself.\n\nI never thought apt was slow until I tried pacman. It was a hell of a lot better than managing software on Windows! Well, now it's It's been over a year since I switched but I'm still blown away by how quickly pacman installs packages. I\\`m not talking about download speeds, but the installation itself. Apart from when running dkms hooks for a new kernel, pacman installs packages amazingly fast compared to apt, which is very sluggish by comparison. What is the secret? Does it have something to do with how the packages are compressed, or is it configured to make better use of multiple cores, or something else? I really want to know. And if it's possible to be this fast, how come the apt devs haven't implemented the necessary changes to their package manager? What am I missing?",

I've tried to move to Linux several times, and I don't know why I hated Ubuntu the 3 times I've used it.\n\nI went to the Steamdeck subreddit a couple of times and I spoke about how much I like Windows (I still do) and how much Linux sucks in gaming and the fact that only 1% of Steam player's base is on Linux.\n\nI have a project that I should start tomorrow or on Tuesday to compare current gaming on Linux to Windows, this will also allow me to compare current Linux gaming to future SteamOS + updated proton.\n\nTo my surprise, I actually like Arch a lot after experimenting a bit and I'm even considering removing Windows all together in the future (after my project), or leave it for future testing. I must admit that I don't understand all the commands I've used, and there are so many ways to install things that some times I can't follow some tutorials and I don't even understand why (you are told to write \"X\" command that should give you certain output and I get an error :P)\n\nAll this said, it is a shame that Linux doesn't get the attention it deserves, it should be the superior platform in all areas (and in some areas is, like servers) but on the consumer side is missing support from developers, specially big ones. I hope Valve keeps pushing Linux and helps to improve gaming even more. The more people use Linux, the bigger the incentive for companies to support Linux will be.\n\nAnd I'm sorry for my comments towards Linux, it's actually cool. All this said, Windows is extremely easy compared to Linux, which I understand it makes many people hesitant of using it. In my case I've used Windows since 3.1, so I'm comfortable with it and I know how to solve most of the problems people use to have with the platform.

I ended up discovering a bug that occurs during a long lived series of interactions with an external API. The bug takes a long time to reproduce (~40 minutes).

    "title": "I dumped Omarchy and went back to a fresh un-opinionated Arch",
    "body": "I gave it about 63 days before I gave up on it. 60 days ago I thought it was awesome. The past 2 weeks it was just annoying. When it became a bootable iso image I was pretty sure they were going to lose me. I didn't want a new distro. I wanted Arch with a a preconfigured Hyprland and development environment.\n\nI think it is kind of funny/sad how the mindset is is break free from your Mac and then they give you a version of Arch that is becoming more and more Mac like in the sense that you need to use Alacritty if you want these tui's to work right, and their modified chromium if you want these web apps to work right. And, oh I see you changed your keybinds, we're going to just change those back even though you did it the way we suggested. DHH has come up with some newer ones and you'll probably like them better than yours.  What? It changes your whole workflow? Funny you should mention that because we're also going to replace your neovim settings too. You might as well just do things our way.\n\nYeah I know it is an opinionated install, I didn't realize it was going to be opinionated updates as well. Just not for me. I did get some benefit from using it. I discovered lazygit and a few other terminal based applications.\n\nSo now that I am back to a fresh Arch install I figured I would give Cosmic a go. I must say I am pretty impressed with it. I like being able to set tiling or floating per work space.\n\n\\*edit\\*\n\nI had a 2nd PC with Omarchy installed, a little HP Mini. I ended up removing Omarchy tonight and keeping my Arch install by doing the following steps.\n\nDisable the Omarchy seamless login service and renable tty1\n\n    sudo systemctl stop omarchy-seamless-login.service\n    sudo systemctl daemon-reload \n    sudo systemctl start getty@tty1.service\n\nIt is easier if you log in on tty2 (ctrl-alt f2) to do this, When you stop the seamless login service it might kick you to a black screen. Once you get rid of the auto login you can also remove the omarchy decryption graphic and replace it with something prettier. You only need to do this if you are using an encrypted disk. If you aren't using LUKS just skip to the .config folder part.\n\n\"plymouth-set-default-theme -l\" will show a list of the themes. I went with bgrt which is basically the spinner theme with your bios or PC manufacturer's boot logo. You need to make sure you specify the -R flag so it will rebuild the initramfs.\n\n    sudo plymouth-set-default-theme -R bgrt\n\nAt this stage I decided to just move my .config folder and start with a fresh one. You don't have to do this part. If you decide to keep your .config folder and keep hyprland, there is a pretty good chance it will get updated back to omarchy again.\n\n    cd \n    mv .config/ .config.bak \n    mkdir .config\n\nThen I just copied over folders I wanted to preserve and omitted things I didn't mind rebuilding from scratch. Below are just some examples. One thing of note. Omarchy symlinks the themes to a lot of their stuff so if you copy nvim or any of your terminal customizations you might want to consider copying the omarchy folder. At the time of writing this, it only has a themes folder and a current theme folder.\n\n    cd .config\n    cp -r ../.config.bak/chromium .\n    cp -r ../.config.bak/retroarch .\n    cp -r ../.config.bak/nvim .\n\nYou can reboot here. You should get a new plymouth screen with the Arch logo at the bottom and whatever theme you picked\n\nFinally you need to get rid of the omarchy mirror and update your mirror list.\n\n    sudo nvim /etc/pacman.conf\n\nscroll down and comment out or remove these lines.\n\n    [omarchy] \n    SigLevel = Optional TrustAll \n    Server = https://pkgs.omarchy.org/$arch\n\nSave it and then run this to rebuild your mirror list\n\n    sudo pacman -Syyu\n\nAt this point you just need to do one more thing, remove omarchy-chromium\n\n    sudo pacman -R omarchy-chromium\n\nYou can re-install the real Chromium if you want it. Having the omarchy fork there will be problematic if you ever want to update Chromium.\n\nNow you are free to install whatever desktop and window manager you would like to use. If you install SDDM you can set that to auto login and go right into whatever you install.\n\nOmarchy is still going to exist in .local/share/omarchy as a git repo. I am keeping it there so I can cannibalize their themes. :)\n\nI hope this proves useful to some people and gets you back to just using Arch btw.",

While the Installation guide is pretty good, there's several little things you probably should do to your system after install, or right now if you never done it before.\n\n* Bootloader\n\nYou should enable automatic updates for your specific bootloader.\n\nSystemd-boot - https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-boot#Automatic_update\n\nGrub - https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GRUB#Warning_to_perform_grub-install/grub-mkconfig_at_each_grub_update\n\nFor others check https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_boot_process\n\n* Locale\n\nIf you use your system in English  but lives outside the US you should set up your locale.conf accordingly, ex.\n\n    LANG=de_DE.UTF-8\n    LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8\n    LC_COLLATE=C.UTF-8\n\n\nIn my case `LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8` guarantee while the system is in English, while `LANG=en_DE.UTF-8` makes that all the other settings are set up to the local German standards.\n\nLC_COLLATE=C.UTF-8 is recommended to be set as `C.UTF-8` by the wiki.\n\nThere's also several other variables that can be set individually but are probably not necessary for the vast majority of people.\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Locale\n\n^Shoutout ^to ^/u/legacynl\n\n* Trim\n\nEnable Trim on your SSDs, either with the discard mount option if you drive and file system support it or using the fstrim.service.\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Solid_state_drive#TRIM\n\n* Makepkg\n\nIf you're constantly using AUR packages you should enable makepkg optimizations. \n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Makepkg#Optimization\n\n* Fonts\n\nInstall the noto-fonts-cjk (or other CJK font pack) so you don't see a bunch of empty squares when people use Chinese Japanese or Korean characters.\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fonts\n\n* Mirrors\n\nInstall and set up Reflector service to keep your mirrors up to date \n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Reflector\n\n* .pacnew\n\nPackage updates will often generate .pacnew files, those files are new config files that have new options or new standards and need to be dealt with promptly. What I do is just run\n\n `$ pacman -Syu &amp;&amp; pacdiff` \n\nand I deal with them immediately, or you can just run \n\n`$ pacdiff` \n\nonce in a while. Not dealing with .pacnew files might cause you problems in the future.\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman/Pacnew_and_Pacsave\n\n* Package cache\n\nClean your package cache periodically so you don't end up with several GB of packages just sitting around.\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman#Cleaning_the_package_cache\n\n* Zram\n\nYou should probably update your old SWAP partiton to Zram, it's better in every way possible, the only caveat is hibernation, I don't use it and I don't know if it's possible to use Zram and still have hibernation.\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Zram\n\nThere's certainly more stuff that I can't think of right now, but leave your tips and I'll update the post with the best ones.",

She got to replace Code with MS VSCode, install a JDK and such things. Just got another text from her saying how arch and Hyprland are cool.

I only ever used windows and I've heard people say arch was insufferably bad to get running and to use. I like challenges and they thought \"why not jump into cold Waters.\"  \n\nI started installing It on an VM, you know just to get started. Later I found out 90% of my issues were caused by said VM and not by Arch itself. Lol\n\nSure I spent like 2 hours to get it running like I wanted to. Sure I had to read the wiki a shitton. But my god the wiki. I love the wiki so much. Genuinely I'm convinced if you just READ arch isn't that bad. Everything is explained, and everything has links that explain the stuff that isn't explained. \n\nAnd the best part about my 2 hours slamming my keyboard with button inputs to put everything in FOOT (don't judge, I couldn't get kitty to run, and when I was finally able to run it foot kinda looked nice to me lol)... Now I understand every inch of my system. Not like in windows where honestly most registry files are still a mystery to me. No! I've spent so much time in the wiki and hammering in the same commands over and over and editing configs that I understand every tiny little detail of my system. I see something I don't like and know how to change it, or at least I know how to find out how to change it. (The wiki most times lol)\n\nAnd don't even get me started about Pacman. Jesus fucking Christ I've never had fun installing programs in windows before. Pacman is just no bs, get me to where I need to be. (Similarly to KDE Discover, but I've heard it's not so nice since it keeps infos from Pacman, oh well, pacman is good enough even without gui)\n\nThe entire experience was just fun. The only time I was frustrated was because of stupid VM issues (that were partly caused by windows(ofc))\n\nI've had it running on a harddrive with Hyprland for a while now. \nOh and Hyprland also yells at you on their website not to use it if you haven't had any Linux experience...

I was a noob too, actually I'm still a noob and I'm learning about linux. I've come across numerous YouTube videos, blogs and articles about 'linuxing' but none of them clicked. I started out with Debian and really liked how Linux worked without any abstractions. \n\nI dived into the world of linux distro and learned about distro hopping quickly. But at this point I didn't know jackshit about linux, I only used it as a newbie. \n\nEver since I laid my eyes on Arch, I was determined to make Arch my own ('my own' as in being the power user Arch actually expects. Sorry my vocabulary limits me from using more sophisticated words as English is not my first language and I can't put my real feelings behind these words). Also there's this cool prestige among people that Arch Linux users are just better. So I typed 'Arch Linux' on my browser, visited the official website and installed the ISO. And of course, I chose to go with the hardest path i.e, manual installation. Guess what? I failed miserably and I couldn't really understand what was happening behind the hood. I felt defeated and chose to switch to EndeavourOS KDE because I wanted to try out Arch without having to deal with the hassle of installation. \n\n6 months later, I decided that it was time to install arch with hyprland. But this time, I had knowledge about the archinstall script. I installed Arch with no issues at all. This time though, there was another issue. Hyprland. I had no fucking clue about what I was balls deep in. In the end, I failed again.\n\nI had to restore my EndeavourOS setup with Timeshift(thank God I had created a backup earlier). I decided to try again but this time I was determined and clicked every single link I came across while reading the Arch Wiki. I mean yes, it took me a lot of time to install the OS but guess what? I actually knew what I was doing this time. Oh and btw I did all of this in gnome-boxes because I was scared of breaking my system. Now I just gotta do this again which won't take much time ;).\n\nBasically my point in writing this huge ass article is that please stop searching for easier alternatives such as YouTube videos and go read the Arch Wiki. There's tons of information in there and many more I still haven't discovered yet! You'll find everything you seek about Arch and Linux in general in there.\n\nI'll post the screenshots of my setup in the comments after I install Arch on my laptop.\n\nThanks for reading!",

I discovered Neovim and fell in love with it - kudos to the Vim creators!\n\nThe hype around Arch kept catching my attention. After some research, I discovered it centered around Arch's DIY philosophy. Curiosity got the better of me, so I decided to give it a shot in a VM first.\n\nI spent about a week learning the installation process through the ArchWiki, Reddit, and some AI assistance. As I dove deeper, each new term led me down fascinating rabbit holes of knowledge. The Wiki's structure is brilliant - it guides you while encouraging exploration of related concepts. I can confidently say the ArchWiki is the finest documentation I've encountered on the internet. It's not just documentation; it's a masterpiece.\n\nDuring this process, I created my own documentation in Obsidian, and ultimately gained a deep understanding of the GNU/Linux system. When I finally installed Arch on my actual machine, I barely needed to reference anything (except for a post-installation audio issue) - it all came naturally.\n\nI now understand that truly knowing Linux comes from building and maintaining your system yourself.

I found the KDE distribution of Linux and just fell in love with the UI and customization ability it provides. Not to mention it reduces so much bloatware that comes with windows OS installs. \nI then decided to commit to arch Linux kde plasma on my main laptop and ditched windows entirely to main my new OS.

    "body": "I always thought arch was too hard for me. Even though I have been using Linux for a long time, arch always was the forbidden distro because of all the fearmongering about it's \"instability\" for daily use.\n\nMaybe I lucked out, but it has been very very stable for me, working perfectly with my laptop for both gaming and programming.\n\nGetting to this post, using arch has been a lifesaver as a graduate student in CS.   \n1. One of my subjects requires me to compile a micro OS called XINU which was built on an ancient build of gcc. Having access to old versions of gcc through the AUR saved me soo much time. I was able to build and test locally without using the slow university servers.\n\n2. Another course requires me to write mpi programs to implement parallel algos and installing openmpi, running the programs across various cores was seamless. Unlike my friend who has an M1 pro macbook, I did not have to fiddle with any settings or break my head in figuring out why the code was not compiling.\n\n3. My operating system course also had in depth studies on how linux works and using linux gave me an easy way to see real world examples of how linux scheduling, memory management and threading works.\n\nAll of these may seem minor, but they were huge time savers and helped me focus on coding rather than fighting with the OS. Most of these are common for all linux distros but the AUR has been the biggest plus for me.",

Its now got Debian w/ plasma installed, which decided to kill itself when I ran an apt autoremove and took out the whole DE - easy enough fix but I've NEVER had arch decide that install-time packages could be flagged as no longer needed and uninstall them.\n\nThroughout all this, my gf has been watching my frustration. Yesterday she asks me \"why don't you just install the same thing as your desktop pc?\"\n\nThe irony that my bleeding edge desktop was more stable than all these fresh installs has not been lost on me.\n\nMaybe with the end of Windows 10 and Recall creeping over the horizon I can convince her to change as well.\n\n(This post has been inspired by u/Malqus's recent post \"My GF started using Arch\", good luck to her buddy)\n\n  \nEdit: Perhaps I should've quoted the first \"stable\", as some of you guys are bringing up the reliable vs stable debate.

Maybe negatives can be higher priority (similar to `nice` values) and positives can be lower priority. That would also allow for packages that need to be installed after all other packages for some reason. \n\nWould there be some downside that I'm missing?

Bought a new laptop recently, has the new Snapdragon chip, which means some stuff just doesn't work if there's no ARM version (there's a built-in translation layer but it doesn't work every time). I was aware of this, and made sure what I needed would work. Overall it works surprisingly well.\n\nI don't know how, but I fell into a Linux YouTube rabbit hole. Every day I'd check if I could install it, but there's not much support for these new chips yet from what I can tell. Some nice people are working on it, but wasn't willing to try and fuck up my new machine. Then I remembered I still have an old laptop.\n\nSo yeah, I gave it a shot, opened the installation guide on the wiki and followed it. Had to google a few things even though they worked fine, it just bothers me to type stuff I don't understand, so it took a few hours. The only issue I had was after partitioning/mounting, installer didn't work, something about invalid or corrupted package, was an issue with the PGP signatures, unfortunately Google gave me a Reddit thread on this very subreddit where the solution immediately worked.\n\nAt the very least I was expecting some issues with bluetooth or something but nah. It's just working. Went for KDE plasma, the animations are kinda choppy, it feels slower than it should be, so thank god for that, I'm trying to fix it... I'm mostly exaggerating my disappointment to not have had issues lmao, because there's still so much tinkering to do that I'm having a lot of fun with it regardless.

    "title": "The most complex Archlinux setup I’ve done",
    "body": "The setup contains the following:\n\n* Archlinux + KDE\n* BTRFS File System with Timeshift Snapshots\n* LUKS Encryption\n* Unified Kernel Images\n* systemd Boot\n* Secure Boot with TPM 2 auto-unlock\n* Dual Boot with Windows with Bitlocker enabled\n* SWAP as a File\n* Recovery UKI and BTRFS Snapshot UKI using the LTS Kernel\n* Hardware: Lenovo L560 with Intel i5 and 16GB of RAM\n\n\tSome background to all of this: This my second time installing Archlinux. First time was a minimal bare-bones setup, using GRUB and no security measures. It was still a dual-boot setup with Windows, but no Secure Boot, no TPM and no Encryption, on either OS-es. Basically, it was just a familiarization with Linux and how it works.\n\n\tBut I loved it! The granularity with which an OS can be manipulated and configured, the privacy, the efficiency. It was all astonishing, especially when coming from a life of using Windows (since 1998).\n\n\tThere were still a lot of boxes I wanted to check. Learning about File Systems, CoW, Snapshots, Unified Kernel Images, UEFI, Secure Boot, TPM2, SWAP, Kernels, and many other things. Diving a bit deeper into how an OS works. I believe that with this setup I mostly managed to do that.\n\n\tI’m going to describe a bit of the most interesting particularities of this setup:\n\n**BTRFS File System with Timeshift Snapshots**\n\n\tBTRFS is great, providing some cool functionalities like snapshots and CoW. My goal was to use said snapshots with a simple yet effective app that had a GUI, like Timeshift. Timeshift requires a very specific layout of the btrfs subvolumes in order to work. An “@“ subvolume for the root partition and a “@home” subvolume for the Home user directory. \n\n\tI’ve seen many setups online, and people were using tons of sub-volumes when setting up their btrfs partitions. Some of them made sense, some were just there for the sake of being there. I decided that for my particular use-case, a root subvolume (“@“) and a home subvolume (“@home”) were enough (which is exactly what Timeshift requires).\n\n**Dual Boot with Windows with Bitlocker enabled and TPM2 auto-unlock for both OS-es**\n\n\tA controversial topic in the world of Archlinux was the success rate of dual-booting Archlinux and Windows, both using Secure Boot, TPM2 auto-unlock and Encryption enabled. I haven’t found many specific examples of this setup working successfully, so it was mostly trial and error on my side. I was determined to do it though, documenting myself with the specifics of UEFI, Secure Boot and TPM2. \n\n\tThe conclusion I reached is that Windows and Archlinux can flawlessly work in a dual-boot setup, both having Secure Boot and TPM2 auto-unlock enabled. The trick is to boot them directly from the UEFI Boot menu (this will allow the PCR7 Secure Boot bank to remain unchanged). If you try to boot Windows from the systemd boot menu (which will detect it as an entry), the PCR7 Secure Boot bank value will change and Bitlocker will prompt for the recovery key. Windows generally uses banks 7 and 11. For my Archlinux setup I’ve used banks 0 and 7.  \n\tEDIT: It is not the PCR 7 bank that changes and doesn't allow Windows to boot through systemd-boot, it is PCR 11, although PCR 7 also has a certain impact. As u/6e1a08c8047143c6869 pointed out: \"I think you mean PCR 11? The secure boot state (i.e. secure boot settings, keys, etc.) will not be changed by booting Windows through systemd-boot, but PCR 11 will\" and \"The issue here seems not to be that PCR 7 changes if you use sd-boot, but that Windows looks at all efi executables in the boot chain and refuses to bind the bitlocker key to PCR7 if any of them were signed by something other than themselves.\"\n\n\tOf course other banks can be used as well, for both OS-es, but the setup becomes gradually more complicated and prone to auto-unlock failure. This depends on one’s threat model.\n\n**Recovery UKI and BTRFS Snapshot UKI using the LTS Kernel**\n\n\tI always thought Safe Mode from Windows was pretty cool for debugging and troubleshooting, yet I did not know how to access something similar on linux. \n\n\tI eventually found out about systemd emergency target, so I created an UKI with mkinitcpio that had the a cmdline file addition that uses the following attribute: “systemd.unit=emergency.target”. This is used to boot the system into an “emergency / minimal” mode using systemd. From here on you can do various things since you have a shell available at your disposal. \n\n\tAnother UKI I made, was one that took advantage of the BTRFS snapshots feature. This one uses the following cmdline addition: “rootflags=subvol=/timeshift-btrfs/snapshots/YYYY-MM-DD\\\\\\_HH\\\\\\_MM\\\\\\_SS/@“ in order to create a UKI that boots a read/write snapshot directly. You can even use Timeshift from within the snapshot to restore the system to a previous point. It was pretty cool and fun when I actually got to see it boot!\n\n\tI decided that both of these \"recovery\" UKIs should use the LTS kernel, as a safety measure. The standard boot entries use the stable Linux kernel.\n\nI basically had 3 cmdline files in my /etc/kernel folder and 2 mkinitcpio presets (linux and linux-lts)\n\n1. The default one “cmdline” using the stable kernel.\n2. The emergency one “cmdline\\_recovery” using the LTS kernel.\n3. The snapshot one “cmdline\\_snapshot” using the LTS kernel as well.\n\nMy boot menu looks like this: [Bootmenu](https://imgur.com/a/rJVx1Nc)\n\nEDIT: When creating this setup I also wrote a full and fairly detailed guide/tutorial on it, just in case I needed to replicate the setup in the future and knowing that there is no way I'd just remember everything in it.\n\nSome people asked for the guide, so here it is: [Guide](https://drive.proton.me/urls/GKX84G630W#X49lqq0aYNYc) (I uploaded it on Proton Drive).\n\nEDIT2: As u/AppointmentNearby161 pointed out, only binding to PCRs measured pre-boot (PCRs 0-7) opens a vulnerability from rogue operating systems. A rogue partition with metadata copied from the real root filesystem (such as partition UUID) can mimic the original partition. More can be read about this on the [Archlinux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-cryptenroll#Trusted_Platform_Module). I also modified the guide to reflect this and to suggest a few potential fixes (be aware that I didn't had the time to test these fixes yet, so implement them with caution).",

I used to run Ubuntu WSL because I was initially a little curious about Linux and I wanted to do some low-level systems programming, which was really complicated with Windows.\n\nFurthermore, my laptop heats up very quickly when I just boot up Windows (task manager giving me ridiculous usage percentages), and I think on 5 different occasions, my screen just melted and glitched so I'd have to restart it or wait some time before I can use it.\n\nHowever, after gradually migrating most of my things to Arch Linux in May 2025, I can say that this is probably the greatest decision I ever made. Before Arch, I never imagined this would be possible:\n\n- Updating everything in my system with just a simple \"yay -Syu\"\n- Have a simple quick package manager that gets me all my essentials\n- Almost no stress on my CPU, GPU and RAM on boot\n- Everything I'll ever need is in less than 100 GB\n- No registry editor hell\n- No \"app is not on my laptop but it's still in my program list\" bs\n- Really high performance\n- I'm more aware about whats really happening to my laptop under the hood\n- Laptop doesn't heat up and send my fan to the damn ER\n- Custom keybinds that make me less reliant on my mouse\n\n...and the list just goes on, man.\n\nToday marks 6 months of me using Arch Linux (+ Hyprland), and I am very, very happy that I moved out of Windows. To be honest I only still kept Windows as a fallback, or when I can't use something on Arch, but 99% of my usage is on Arch.\n\nI really want to thank a lot of YouTube channels and the Arch and the overall Linux community for making this happen for me man, this is just awesome.",

This was a bit messy, because my root partition isn't big enough, so I moved the pacman cache to the /home partition, but pacstrap wouldn't have it. Never mind, just remove the pkg symlink and make an empty directory instead.\n\nSo pacman is installed and it's time to arch-chroot and finish the system upgrade now. One small problem - I forgot to mount the boot partition, which resulted in the kernel going to wrong place and an unbootable system. Another small problem, I don't remember how I've setup the system boot. The system boots directly (only Arch on it), but I don't remember if I used a boot manager and which one was it.\n\nOK, time to install a boot manager. Just a simple one. Maybe I was using [rEFInd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/REFInd). I installed it and voila - a bootable system again. So breakage fixed. In fact two breakages - one caused by pacman and a second one caused by me. Now I can say Arch broke on me, btw! It took a few years, but I got the badge.\n\nIn the end it turns out that rEFInd was not the boot manager I wanted, because it displays a wacky boot menu.

So my dumbass thought let's format that partition from Windows Disk Management and I will install Arch on that partition and that was a huge mistake. \n\nAs I rebooted after formatting, I saw the grub command line which scared me a bit(seeing for the first time) but after searching online on how to boot from .efi file I booted into Windows, removed grub(after some online research) flashed Arch on a USB, booted into the USB and lo and behold I can install Arch now.\nI thought I could go the easy way with arch install but that didn't support dual boot ig or I couldn't figure out how to setup dual boot from arch install.\n\nActually Arch wiki is the best way to install Arch after 2 hours installing it for the 3rd time(1st install had mounted drives setup incorrectly and in the 2nd I messed up the Grub setup) it finally worked, booted from Grub Menu at Reboot everything worked fine, but wait a minute there is no Windows boot option in the Grub Menu because for some reason os-prober wasn't finding the Windows efi file, had to make a manual entry for Windows in the Grub Menu(prior research on where Windows efi file existed actually helped) and viola it's 3am(started at 11 pm if I remember correctly) and both Windows and Arch are booting properly.\n\n\n\nBonus: In the morning when I again boot Arch to install that quickshell and hyprland theme, iwctl didn't work(which it did in the setup) because it doesn't exist so again I boot the USB, mounted the drives correctly(I am good at it now) downloaded nmcli from inside there, removed the USB and now I could connect to the WiFi finally. Rest is history as it was smooth sailing from there onwards I still haven't had any issues from Arch except from caelestia-dots and quickshell which were fairly easy and minute fixes not really related to arch.\n\nThose 3-4 hours I spent installing actually helped me learn a lot more about how these software and hardware behave and is a journey I will probably remember for a long time.\n\n\n\nPS.

Many of the free written responses expressed a great deal of gratitude to you, and that gratitude is well deserved! Without you, this community simply wouldn't be, so thank you!\n* [Brodie Robertson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSyUvkpHv6M&amp;t=37s)! Thank you for showcasing our survey on your channel! It was unexpected, but thanks to your help, our survey had a significant increase in reach, and we appreciate it very much!\n* All **3,923** who participated! Without you, the snapshot of data we were able to capture wouldn't be what it is. So thank you for your time and contribution!\n* All who provided feedback! you've given us many tools and perspectives for use in the future, and have proven the value of community wisdom, so thank you very much!\n\n**Acknowledgement of Flaws**\n\n* Sample size: While we did see a significant sample, there may be variance when compared to the whole Arch user base.\n* Cultural / Lingual / Selection biases: This survey was only provided in English, to an Arch subreddit largely conducted in English\n* Self reported: We're taking everyone at their word\n* And others... Just know that we aren't claiming perfection here.\n\nBut overall, we think it was taken appropriately, and that the results are accurate and insightful\n\n**Explanation of Method**\n\nIt's important to know that not everyone saw the same set of questions. Those who expressed that they had not yet tried Arch were given a separate section, so as to ask them a more appropriate set of questions. This group was also asked many analogous questions to the main group, so that some comparisons could be drawn.\n\n**Highlights of Results**\n\nHere, I'll direct your attention to a few of the results I found interesting, but in the interest of both digestibility and letting the community draw its own conclusions, I'll keep this on the brief side\n\n* The posts we see don't represent the lingual diversity that's actually present on the subreddit\n   * Only **45.1%** of respondents claim English as their primary language.\n   * And **12.6%** or respondents reported an English proficiency that I would expect encounters communication difficulties at least some of the time.\n* We seem to have a wide, and fairly even distribution of experience. There are more users with relatively short terms of usership, but it does look like people tend to stay with Arch\n* Those who haven not yet tried Arch generally wish to use Arch in the future (**57%**)\n* The most cited reasons for not yet trying Arch are (in descending order)\n   * Setting up Arch involves too much configuration\n   * Stability issues, or concerns about stability issues\n   * The install process itself\n   * Happier with another distribution\n* Gaming compatibility is still a concern for **11.2%** of those who haven't tried Arch yet\n   * On the other hand, **77.6%** of Arch users report gaming as one of the activities they use Arch to do\n* KDE Plasma is by far the favorite graphical environment for both those who use Arch, and those who haven't yet (**36.8%** and **43%** respectively)\n   * Hyprland and Gnome are the silver and bronze medalists\n      * Among Arch users Hyprland has **26.4%** and Gnome has **10.8%**\n      * Among Arch Excluded, Gnome has **21.5%** and Hyprland has **13.2%**\n   * Arch users also have a noticeable affinity for Sway (**4.6%**), i3 (**4.4%**), and xfce (**3.4%**)\n   * COSMIC may be new, but it's already attracted a lot of attention\n      * **17.7%** of respondents report having given it a try\n      * **1.3%** of respondents declared COSMIC as their favorite\n* Kitty and Konsole were neck and neck for the favorite terminal emulator as the results were coming in, but the ultimate favorite was Kitty (**30%**). Konsole finished with **23.5%**, and Alacritty finished with **17.4%**\n   * I didn't expect Foot to be as popular as it was, and I apologize for not including it in the initial prompt. Foot has the hearts of **4.74%** of respondents, making it overall, the 5th most popular.\n\n**Hardware Breakdown**\n\nCPU\n\n|\\-|Intel|AMD|Other|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Arch Users (3798)|41.8%|57.7%|0.34%|\n|Arch Excl (123)|41.5%|55.3%|3.25%|\n\n* Others mentioned include Apple Silicon, ARM, \"I don't Know\", and responses reporting that they have multiple main systems with differing configurations.\n\nGPU\n\n|\\-|Nvidia|AMD-D|AMD-I|Intel-D|Intel-I|Other|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Arch Users (3794)|40%|31.7%|10.1%|1%|15.3%|1.98%|\n|Arch Excl (123)|42.3%|28.5%|8.1%|0|15.4%|5.69%|\n\n* For brevity, \"D\" indicates \"dedicated\", and \"I\" indicates \"integrated\"\n* Others mentioned include \"I don't know\", Apple Silicon, ARM, Hybrid configurations, and responses reporting that they have multiple main systems with differing configurations\n\nRoot Hard Drive\n\n|\\-|M.2 / NVMe|Sata SSD|Sata HDD|External HD|Other|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Arch Users (3768)|77%|17.9%|3.4%|0.5%|1.17%|\n|Arch Excl (0)|n/a|n/a|n/a|n/a|n/a|\n\n* Others mentioned include: Virtual, eMMC, Flash Drive / SD, Floppy Drive, Fusion Drive, and IDE HDD\n\n**Highlights from long form responses**\n\n* There were many long form responses thanking those who develop or contribute to Arch. There were even some saying that I should have mentioned something about donations in the survey\n   * I probably won't include this in a future survey *directly*, but if you're grateful for Arch , and wish to express some of that gratitude, the following link is where you can do so. If you can't, no worries, but if you can, even a small donation is very helpful\n   * Donate: [https://archlinux.org/donate/](https://archlinux.org/donate/)\n* By far, the most common long form response was \"*I use Arch, btw*\"\n   * I too use Arch ... ... ... btw\n* Another common response was those which expressed gratitude for the Wiki\n   * A little looking, a little reading, and a little patience does go a long way!\n* *my answer to \"my preferred way of completing a task\" question, is more like \"depends on how easy or annoying it is on cli/gui\"*\n   * I do apologize for the vague nature of this question. This response was included as an elaboration to that question, and I believe it represents well what the poll results were trying to convey. I'll try to give that question some better direction next time.\n* Some users expressed a want for Arch to support ARM, or for Arch Linux ARM to pick up support\n   * Given the recent direction consumer hardware has started moving, I agree, this would be nice to see\n* Many users wish to tell their past selves to \"*Take your backups!*\"\n   * They walked so we can run!\n\nAnd many, many more... I'll be reading through all these responses for quite a while. (Access to the complete set of long form responses seems to be limited due to volume. This was not set by us, and I will do what I can to make them all available, but I don't yet have an answer)\n\nThere's a lot more to be discovered in the full results. So if you have time, I encourage giving them a look! Please feel free to share your discoveries in the comments.\n\nWith that, this is the conclusion of this survey! I have so much gratitude for all who participated and contributed, so thank you to everyone. I look forward to seeing you all for the next one!\n\nEdit: Appending the [Survey Opening Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1hf7yda/arch_linux_community_survey/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

    "body": "I want share my experience how i moved from windows to arch. I'm start watch videos on youtube about linux and distributes. It was just for fun, 2 years ago i can't imagination how i change my OS from windows to some distributive at linux. 2 weaks ago i go buy new ssd disk for arch, because i want leave my OS at windows at second disk, I need some programs which exists only at windows. Before downloading arch I'm tried use WSL, but it was not good, i dont enjoy it. But moment, when i bought new disk and download my first distro in my life and how i know arch mark as hard distro for new, this was perfect. My first login in system was a good, but one moment. My second monitor have problems, my GHZ was 60 and when I changed, that was 60 GHZ. I had the opportunity to change my GHZ and I click save, but any changes. So, my friends say: \"You have a problems with drivers, fix this\". I go to fix. Maybe I spent one day for fix and right now my second monitor work good, without any problem. When I'm fix, maybe I removed some driver and my second monitor did't work. After i start work with Vs code and i had also some problems, because more extantions don't find if I download vs code from official website, but i can find more extanstions if I download from software store, but I can't use yarn or something else. I find solution just download with yay. It's helped me. \n\nI'm moved to arch beacuse windows have many useless updates, which eat my GB at ssd disk. And system was slow for coding, because many trash was downloaded at my pc, from me and from windows. I'm never like tab with news or more trash from windows. I'm every time clean my disk, because updates have a big size (my ssd 220+gb) and every update take many GB of my memory. With arch i don't have any problems with sizes, I downloaded at my system only things, which i need. I don't see any news every launch, i don't see any updates and crashes. Windows have a good sides also, but arch I liked more then windows. Perhaps not much time for my review, but I think its okay. I use this system just for coding, but this coding became a comfortable at 100%\n\nMaybe someone want also share own road to linux or experience",

I did not know how to partition the drives, it's because I refused to read and comprehend the instructions by the guides.

I did not understand that I have to put \"root\" on the login, so I was just stumped there and kept reinstalling until I used my head and used google.  \n8.) did not understand that I have to use **sudo nano /etc/locale.conf** and the other instructions that told me to edit something in etc/ folder. I was just there stumped asking why the \"command\" /**etc/locale.conf** is not working  \n9.) did not install bootloader  \n10.) did not install efibootmgr  \n11.) did not install networkmanager or iwd  \n12.) did not search how to cancel a ping so I was stuck there for 30 mins just waiting for ping to end learned that I can just control c by just experimenting.  \n13.) put my country in the part where you /usr/region/city /localtime of something.

Fedora was just overall very buggy in my opinion.\n\nUp to this point I’ve stayed away from arch hearing that it’s impossible to install and use, ran arch install and it was as straight forward as any other distro, set up time shift with btrfs snapshots and installed an LTS kernel (because I’ve heard of arch breaks this will come in handy), as easy as you’d want. No issues, at this point I’m bewildered as I’ve set up a minimal system with literally nothing going wrong, (was also easy af using the arch manual) but then came the games, installed goverlay Mangohud and gamemode, no problem, played a brand new released game (Like a dragon pirate yakuza in Hawaii) fedora had weird audio issues with this game among other issues but on arch, nothing, perfect. \n\nArch was my last ditch effort at Linux after trying 10+ distros and so far it’s been absolutely flawless, the only thing I fear now is an update causing my system to break, but falling back to an LTS kernel or using timeshift should be the solution.\n\nSince I do not tinker around with my Linux systems I hope my arch installation will keep working for the foreseeable future, I’ll barely be using the AUR, all I do is web browsing and gaming and with fedoras freezing and audio issues even that was a pain.

Some were fixed with a local rebuild and reinstall by the user, using the new version of `icu` on their system. `-bin` packages needed to be rebuilt by the AUR maintainer and released with a new version.\n\nAlso, take special care to [not have partial upgrades](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/System_maintenance#Partial_upgrades_are_unsupported), as this caused official repo packages to break in the previous icu update too (including `pacman` itself, and unbootable systems). Just do a `pacman -Syu` to prevent or fix that.\n\nFor a temporary solution to get the problematic AUR packages working:\n\n[icu75](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/icu75) from AUR can be installed, if you have already updated to `icu-76` via pacman. This will let you have the old version alongside the new version, so that those AUR applications still have access to the older libraries. When the problematic packages' AUR maintainers update them, you would no longer need the `icu75` package. (I have not tested the new `icu75` package myself, but this was the nicest solution for the previous icu update issues.)\n\ne.g. [ungoogled-chromium-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ungoogled-chromium-bin) seems to be broken now, with a new version currently being compiled by the maintainer.",

OR if it fails to run mkinitcpio during your update, be sure to fix the config and re-run it or you wont be able to boot. \n\nHere is the forum thread in question:\n\nhttps://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=304822\n\nEDIT 2:\nThis deprecation possibly should have had a corrisponding news item on the Arch homepage to save us from sky is falling claims of broken kernel builds.

I installed Gentoo several times, enchanted by the romance of compiling packages from source (and each time, that romance was shattered after the tedious wait for compilation to finish, only to gain negligible performance improvements) and the constant issues with broken dependencies.\n\nI also tried NixOS. I really liked the idea of a declarative system setup, where everything could be configured via a config file and modules… But the lack of normal FHS, and the fact that all issues had to be solved strictly the Nix way… Also NixOS has a terrible documentation, NixOS documentation made me appreciate ArchWiki even more than before! Oh, and the huge problems it caused for me as a programmer due to the system’s peculiarities… All of that just wasn’t worth the effort. None of it was worth it, even though I loved the idea of a declarative distro.. Maybe it's just a skill issue from my side, but.. nggaaaah!\n\nAt the same time, I always came back to Arch because, for me now, it’s like home. I know everything I need to know about it, it’s minimalist, and it doesn’t demand any super-deep knowledge or excessive time investment to get what I want. After every new distro I tried - I always returned to Arch and was glad that everything was just the way it should be. No need for killer features from exotic distros - those usually end up being the reason why users leave them. Though, of course, to each their own. If you like that - go for it, but I’d still prefer Arch.",

I did several arch linux installation, and if I need to choose a PC OS, I'll use arch.\n - I don't want to use Debian server, because it feels a bit old. It seems that debian is very stable, but that it isn't very well updated. I dunno if this is much of an issue, so please tell me.\n - I don't want to use Ubuntu Server, because I don't really like how Ubuntu is. For me, it's really bloated, and I don't like having a bloated server. Maybe it's just me, so again, please tell me your opinion.\n\nCons:\n - Rolling updates: A lot of people doesn't like Arch because each day, there are new updates and you NEED to check your server each day, and make a lot of maintenance for it. I dunno if this is much of a problem, so again, please tell me.\n\nSome people proposed me Void Linux, but again, please tell me your opinion\n\n(EDIT AFTER 30 DAYS)\nOkay so RemindMe bot just reminded me this message.\n\nSo, after 30 days (I guess), I got my server, and it was really good !!!\nI saw on htop less process than Ubuntu Server, but I don't really know if this is better, and if I just didn't make a placebo effect.\nPerformance side, the minecraft server didn't changed much.\nUsability side: I didn't have much of updates to make, once a week it worked well. Because I like arch, it was easier to me to use arch than ubuntu server, but if you like ubuntu server/debian, go for it.\n\nSo, the conclusion: Using arch as a server wasn't much of a difference; You don't really need to check every day for an update, but there isn't a really big performance gap between both.\nUse Arch for server if you know how to use it, and if you're comfortable with arch.

Why not? I just finished my exams and i have little better to do before I start my summer job.\n\nIt was just a straight forward install...\n\nSure, you had to mess with some config files and partition some drives. But most of this stuff is things that most people have done before. I anyways needed to mess with the Fstab to mount my Sambashares and make users with different perms so my partner can use my computers without accidentally messing with my system. (or atleast lowering the risk). This stuff that I usually do after the installation, I just got the opportunity to do during the installation. Different, but not more difficult.\n\nThe real thing that I found a bit difficult was getting the boot loader to work. So yah, that did take an hour or so, I must admit. But I would not consider it too painful with the Arch-Wiki literally holding my hand through the entire process.\n\nI do say that I am enjoying Arch so far. I have felt like I needed to wrestle some of the pre-installed software in openSUSE to get my system working like I wanted it too. Which is something I am yet to feel in Arch. But other than that its just a normal working distribution. I have been scammed into thinking it was this super complicated integrates system of machinery lol.\n\nI guess what I am trying to express is that Arch is more mundane than what a lot of people hype it up to be.

Thus, after looking for what security things I could do, I went down the Secure Boot on Linux rabbit hole.\n\nAfter a few hours of messing around with shim and getting it working with the default keys, I realised I was still weak and not asserting full dominance over the machine, for this way I was using Microsoft's Secure Boot keys, which made things easier, but, Microsoft, you know? I use Arch btw, I do things my way, I don't want no Microsoft here.\n\nWith newfound energy, I went down the custom Secure Boot keys hole. I updated my BIOS to the latest stable version to have all the fancy features and fixes, and off I went!\n\nThis one far more interesting, for it involved figuring the keys out, which was a lot of fun, generating them, setting up auto-signing of the kernels as pacman hooks... Lots of fun stuff to spend a day doing.\n\nBut the final stretch was truly the most fun - messing with the firmware to get it added as an allowed key in the first place! The part that involves jank because your mobo's manufacturer added the feature in for UEFI compliance and probably never tested it!\n\nAfter ~~slowly losing my mind~~ bashing the keyboard in this one specific way, I figured out the idiosyncrasies Gigabyte wanted me to do to get a custom key enrolled and allowed to boot.\n\nSuccess! I did it! I achieved Security Enlightenment! No more pesky malicious files could ever be booted to possibly log my disk encryption password! All the security! I reboot to behold in admiration all the invisible processes happening to secure all, in my naturally optimised setup with 1 whole whopping second shaved off the regular boot time.\n\nI tremble in anticipation of all the power I am about to assert before this machine, all the security!\n\n---\n\nNo POST. Hmm, that's odd, I only set up Secure Boot with a custom key, no other settings were changed. I reboot again. No POST, nothing. I stare contest the motherboard's pretty lights. Bootlooped after a few seconds, huh. That's most peculiar!\n\nI start disconnecting hardware. Re-plugging cables, checking the power supply. All looking mighty fine. I take out the CMOS battery to reset everything. Nothing. No POST. Only pretty lights for me to stare at. I briefly consider hanging it on the wall as a decoration.\n\nThis is *most* peculiar.\n\n---\n\nI went to RMA the motherboard, thankfully still under warranty, and, surprisingly, it *didn't* magically start working when demonstrating it to the tech! Now that would have been awkward!\n\nA few weeks later I got a new motherboard, unclear whether it was a full replacement or a repair, however. I can henceforth conclude that Gigabyte agreed with me on this being most peculiar and very un-supposed to happen, for otherwise I would have been charged for the fix.\n\nAnd this is how the power of customisability and doing it all my own way has shown me I am powerful enough to brick an entire motherboard by just enrolling an approved key for Secure Boot.\n\n---\n\nI never shared this with anyone in writing, ahah, maybe this silly way of sharing it gets a few laughs out of you.",

    "body": "Trying out Linux on Ubuntu was also a great decision because it lead me into the world of Linux.  \nGetting into Linux puts you down a path of gaining more and more understanding and control over your machines.  \nI first attempted to install arch 5-6 years ago.  \nAt that point I had experience in webdev and running python and Arduino C++ on micro-controllers.  \n\nAt that point I switched from Ubuntu to Archlinux on a whim, just because I wanted try out something new.   \nI fumbled my way through the install following along the guide on the archwiki.  \nAfter I had got all my partitions correct, chrooted, setup grub, and my user and passwd to login, I tried booting it up from disk.    \n\nI was confused why there was only a black terminal with simple text for me to input my username.  \nI was even more confused why there was nothing to click on once I logged in.  Just a blinking cursor in the terminal.  \n\nAfter some googling, I realized I had to install a desktop environment (I chose XFCE).  \nThen I went through choosing which other programs I wanted to install with pacman until I figured out that some packages aren't there and you had to use the Arch User Repository and go through this whole make build process.  \nThen I discovered there was an AUR package to make installing AUR packages easier called `yay` (although I use paru now).  \nI got everything eventually setup into a usable state within few days to a week or so and decided I wanted to try in on my work machine.  \n\nTwo months later I horribly mis-configured something so that my computer was never able to shutdown and always saw some sort of `watchdog` message on repeat.  \n\nFast-forward to now, I am comfortable setting up a new machine with archlinux from scratch and have my dotfiles stored in a repo.  \nI don't need clicky DEs anymore and use `i3` (it's dope).  \nI don't rice too hard, just `picom` and a nice randomized background with `feh`.  \nI escaped VSCode and now neovim as my editor.  \nI also love/depend on `tmux` and miss it most whenever I am back on a Windows machine.  \nI never bothered with a display manager and just enter `startx` to launch i3.  \nIf I fail my password too many times in a sudo command (which happens embarrassingly often) I developed a habit of switching TTYs, logging in as root user and using `faillock` to let me try again.  \n\nAt this point I am still nowhere close to being an expert of archlinux or most things Linux related.  \nBut getting into archlinux helped me learn and grow so much more as a programmer than if I had stayed complacent with Windows and Ubuntu.  \nIt helped me discover my tastes and realize that was even an option on an operating system.  \nIt can look and feel the way I want it to.  \n\nAll that being said, I am feeling pretty cozy and complacent here now though and doubt I will switch to a different OS anytime soon :)",

I had only ever tried Ubuntu and Debian in the past only ever as a dual boot thing never really sunk my teeth into it. So I decided to install Arch on my gaming PC's. It made sense, I built the computers so I should do the same with the OS.\n\nThe challenge I set to myself was I was only allowed to use the wiki and reddit but not directly ask anyone anything. I found so many answers here and now I have a fully functioning system set up exactly how I want it. Security is how I want it, I have pretty much all of my steam library working with no issues thanks to protondb. \n\nBasically you've made me fall in love with computing again. I even loved spending 6 hours trying to get my system to auto mount my other drives on boot and allow steam to use them. (All of this could have been avoided if I simply read the description on the flatpak page haha) \n\nI feel like I've learned so much despite being a computer tech for years. Open source software is truly incredible. The biggest revaltion for me as a windows user since windows 95 was that software can be safe. I had some old tv shows in avi format and I tried so many solutions to get these converted and playable on my tv. It was just the same garbage sites offering these trials and you pay through your teeth. Then I found handBrake it is perfect and feature rich.\n\nJust wish I'd done it sooner.

GNOME has been rock solid for me, and I have discovered it is far more customizable than I gave it credit for\n* **Custom** **4K GRUB themes** → not only functional but also really slick to look at\n\nThe result?

    "body": "After months of trying a bit of Fedora in Virtualbox, I decided to make the switch.\n\n\nI'm not entirely new to Linux, I have experience in using the cli because I needed to ssh to a work server to retrieve or upload files.\n\n\nThe reason why I wanted to move to Linux was because I couldn't stand how Windows throws ads at me everywhere, along with how much of a ram hog it has gotten (Have you seen how much of ram Windows can use on idle?). It also has the issue of forced updates, along with how the OS just \"doesn't work when I want it to\". \n\n\nWell of course it was hard to make the switch still until I saw Pewdiepie's video. Here I thought, \"If a non-tech YouTuber can customise all of that, I can do it too\"\n\n\nSo I decided to backup my important files to another drive, and funnily enough I feel like Windows could sense it's death is coming as explorer.exe when I tried to open the file browser. Worse of all, when I tried to restart it, guess what? Task Manager of all things crashed too. After an hour of trying to wrestle with this system, along with repairing the Windows Installation (Which was corrupted when I checked, and don't worry my disks and ram are fine when I did checks). I backed up my files and decided to move to Linux. \n\n\nNow at this point I was terrified, I've never fully left Windows before, but I thought the first leap is always the hardest. If things break, let it break, I have backups so whatever. \n\n\nThe first distro I went to was Fedora, I got it running but... Oh dear, Nvidia doesn't play nice. I got it up and running but nope, something else breaks. \n\n\nI decided to try another distro, OpenSUSE Tumbleweed. Installed it, it works... Nvidia again. I never managed to get Nvidia working there, and I got the issue where shutting down would lead to seeing blank terminal screen with just an underscore there. \n\n\nI tried to find solutions, but I didn't really have luck. I noticed one pattern however whenever I searched for solutions online. I always see Arch Wiki in the search results of Google. \n\n\"Arch Linux? Isn't that the distro with the hardest installation procedure?\"\n\n\nThe biggest factor that made me want to try is the community and the Arch Linux Wiki.\n\n\nI took the plunge, spent an entire weekend morning trying to install it. The full terminal experience was scary but the Arch Wiki is amazing on guiding through the whole installation.\n\n\nWhen it was finally over, I got everything up and running, Nvidia worked, all my sound drivers and WiFi worked too. \n\n\nI would like to say I appreciate the Arch Wiki, because they have the best documentation of pretty much almost anything on installing Arch Linux and getting it running. I am happy with my new system, I got a taste of freedom. No more ads, no more forced updates. System works when I tell it to work.\n\n\nIs it a beginner distro in my opinion? No. \nIs it good at learning Linux? It's excellent. \nInstalling Arch Linux is pretty much a \"I get it now\" meme moment for me. \n\n\nTo anyone considering to jump to Linux: Back up your files and take the plunge. The first step is the hardest I know but it's worth it. \n\n\nTo anyone considering to try Arch Linux: The hardest part is reading and following instructions, I cannot stress this enough. It's not the cli commands, it's reading that's hard. The world has made it such that our attention spans are pretty much like a goldfish now, and I swear it's somehow making us dumber each day, like there's an agenda to make us dumber on purpose.\n\n\nThank you to the Arch community, you guys are awesome. \n\n\nI can finally say: I use Arch btw\n\nEdit: Typo",

Whenever the RAM usage increases to around 5-7 GB, the system optimizes aggressively, reducing the usage back to 3-5 GB. During this process, the screen occasionally freezes for a few seconds. While I appreciate Arch's minimalism and efficiency, I have 16 GB of RAM and would prefer it to use the available memory rather than optimizing so aggressively that it causes noticeable lags.\n\nMy primary goal with Arch is to deepen my understanding of Linux internals and enjoy a tailored experience—not necessarily to hyper-optimize resource usage at the cost of smooth performance. I also dislike the stereotype that Arch or Linux users are only using old, underpowered machines. Many of us have modern hardware, and it’s important to ensure Linux distributions make full use of it.\n\nI’ve gone through the documentation, but most of the advice I’ve found focuses on reducing RAM and CPU usage—essentially the opposite of my problem. I’d like guidance on how to configure my system to prioritize stability and performance over excessive optimization.",

Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away permanently unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because we love Reddit, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.\n\nThe two-day blackout isn't the goal, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.\n\n**What can you do?**\n\nComplain. Message the mods of /r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit\n\n\n**submit a support request** \n\ncomment in relevant threads on /r/reddit, such as this one, leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.\n\n**Spread the word**. \n\nRabble-rouse on related subreddits.

    "body": "I just had the most ridiculous bug I have seen in my 15 years of Linux.  \n\nI was watching a movie in VLC, in fullscreen. It was a first time I've seen this movie. In one scene, the character turned off all lights, and screen went black. In the darkness, someone was talking, fighting, running for ten minutes. I was sitting there wondering at the creativity of the movie director, until I got bored and wanted to stop it. Then I found out that controls don't work. Including Alt-Tab and other system hotkeys. Ctrl-Alt-Esc saved the day. I started the movie again and found out that actually there is a video right after the black moment!\n\nSo, when VLC encounters a total black moment in video, it stops showing the picture forever (while playing sound) and somehow stops hotkeys from DE working. Only X server's hotkeys work. Further testing shows that it happens only on Arch (latest VLC version, I guess), only in KDE, only in fullscreen and only when VDPAU decoder is on and used. It also only happens with digitally made movies because only they can have totally black frames. Home video and analog tapes always have at least some noise. \n\nImagine the bewilderment I was in for the first time! Heh. \n\nP.S. VLC bugtracker refused me in registration, so I am not reporting it. It is a keeper!\n\nP.P.S. VDPAU, I mean VDPAU decoder. The Nvidia one. I always forget those names.",

Of course I hit them with \"I use Arch btw\", and when they asked me as to why I chose that distro, I said \"It's neat and minimalist while also being a bleeding edge distro\", and then they hit me with \"Well we're running Arch on our servers\" – these guys need the latest libraries and things like that, not gonna get into details. Needless to say, I got pretty excited about that prospect and didn't wait to express that.\n\nAfter a couple more questions I was told that they're gonna get back to me in somewhere around a week or so, we said our goodbyes and the interview was over. Then, some 5-10 minutes later I remembered about some aspect of the conditions or something like that, so I went ahead and asked the recruiter about that. Out of the blue, she hits me with: \"We decided that you're a suitable candidate for this position\" and all that. Having a soft skills interview on Monday, but that's more of a formality, pretty much like interviews with recruiters. Never had issues with neither former, nor latter.\n\nSo, what I'm getting at is it looks like what started as my little experiment to see if I'd like Linux more than Windows, turned into genuine passion and with a little bit of additional complementary skills learning – into a decent job, so there's one more reason to love Arch. To say that I feel on top of the world would be an understatement.",

    "body": "So, this is mostly just a thank you to all those selfless folks that put in time to maintain packages, update and maintain the wiki, and all the other things I'm not even smart enough to mention. \n\nIt's been about 10 years since I discovered Linux in general, and only about 3 since I've been familiarizing myself with Arch and the other distros out there. I've absolutely fallen in love with the idea of open source, community-driven knowledge and software. \n\nRecently, I've been dealing with a lot: I'm trying to finish my last 9 credit hours to graduate with my bachelors in CS, I'm married, I have a job lined up for when (... not if) I graduate, and I've been in custodial court for the last 6 years over my daughter. Last night I hit a bit of a wall, and found myself pretty down. Like, couldn't muster the energy to do ANYTHING, down. I'm sure some of you are familiar with that feeling. \n\nI decided I'd give a go of getting Arch installed on my new laptop, alongside Windows. I've done several Arch installs now without hitch, but getting UEFI working with Windows was something I hadn't attempted yet, and definitely made me a little nervous to try. I figured that, if nothing else, I'd be able to distract myself by working on that until I got tired and needed to go to bed. \n\nLo and behold, as is always the case, the Arch Wiki was my Bible. I had it all working successfully within about 2 hours of starting this little mini-quest. Believe it or not, all it took was this small victory to get me out of my slump. I woke up feeling optimistic and a little proud of myself for at the very least being able to RTFM, lol. \n\nSo, thanks again for all your nerds out there that make this kind of thing possible. Thank you for everyone who pours over the Wiki, correcting out-of-date pages and ensuring it maintains good readability. Thank you for helping me remember that there's always tomorrow, and that we can always find inspiration in the most unusual and unexpected ways.\n\nEdit: hey everybody, stop spending your money or whatever on awards! Just dropping a “&lt;3” in the comments can achieve the same effect. Regardless, thank you from the bottom of my heart for the love. It means a lot. If anyone ever needs a stranger to talk to about ANYTHING, be it work, Linux, girls (no promises on my ability to help there, though), depression, or how stupid the two-party political system is, please don’t hesitate to drop me a line.",

    "body": "I've performed a dark ritual experiment in an ***unsupported*** way of running Arch and collected real-world data throughout a one-year period. This is purely for research purposes and should not be blindly followed.\n\nTLDR: Arch has been rock solid and yielded 99.96% availability via unattended updates, and greatly exceeded my expectations.\n\nOne year ago, I created an instance at Oracle Cloud and decided to run Arch Linux on it. It's a minimalist installation of the `base` system, the `linux` kernel, the `grub` bootloader, and a bunch of packages such like VPN service. This instance is for the sole purpose of a VPN server. The total number of packages installed is around 145. I sticked to the default configuration as much as possible to minimise chances of generating `pacnew`.\n\nI was curious what would happen if I do unattended updates and reboot on a daily basis.\n\nContent of `/root/autoupdate.sh`:\n\n    date &gt;&gt; /root/autoupdate.log\n    pacman -Syu --noconfirm &gt;&gt; /root/autoupdate.log 2&gt;&amp;1\n    reboot\n\nContent of `crontab -e`:\n\n    15 20 * * * /root/autoupdate.sh\n\nList of systemd services enabled by me:\n\n    cronie\n    haveged\n    VPN service\n    sshd\n    paccache.timer\n    systemd-networkd\n    systemd-networkd-wait-online\n\nLast year the Arch installation guide still recommended `dhcpcd`. However, this later proved to be problematic for the VPN service to start correctly only after the network is up. I replaced it with `systemd-networkd`, and this has been the only major maintenance ever required throughout the whole year.\n\nI queried the log of the VPN service via `journalctl -u &lt;VPN service name&gt;`. Then I exported the timestamps of the stopping and starting of the VPN service, and worked out that the total downtime has been 2 hours, 53 minutes and 18 seconds throughout the last 327 days (omitted about a month due to log lost to a restoration from a snapshot). This is 99.96% availability.\n\nLuckily my VPS instance never got borked due to a new format of configuration required. List of `pacnew` files found via `cat /var/log/pacman.log | grep pacnew`:\n\n    /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.pacnew\n    /etc/locale.gen.pacnew\n    /etc/systemd/homed.conf.pacnew\n    /etc/default/grub.pacnew\n\nDisk usage has converged to 3.8 GiB while `paccache.timer` keeps the last 3 versions of each package.\n\nConclusion:\n\nWith minimalist installation and minimal customisation, it is possible to let Arch roll unattended without human intervention. Packages from the Core repo has proved to be of high quality. Hopefully this data provides some insight into building high-availability systems with failover relying on Arch unattended.",

After you added the parameter reboot your laptop.\n\nrun **sudo nano /etc/intel-undervolt.conf**\n\nDecrease the CPU mV by -10 like this.\n\n    undervolt 0 'CPU' -10\n\nSave and exit then run **sudo intel-undervolt apply &amp;&amp; sudo intel-undervolt read** and check it applied properly.\n\nNext stress test for system stability as undervolting can cause a system to crash or hang, run **yay -S mprime**\n\nrun **mprime**\n\nStress test for 30 minutes, then decrease the mV by -10 for every successful run until your laptop crashes or hangs, once you find the sweet spot you can enable the undervolt service run **sudo systemctl enable intel-undervolt.service** make **sure** your system runs stable before enabling this service as it can result in an unbootable or unstable system.\n\n[Arch Wiki page for undervolting](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Undervolting_CPU).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Step 6. Hibernation Suspend and Swap\n\n* Swap makes memory management for your laptop easier,[\\[1\\]](https://haydenjames.io/linux-performance-almost-always-add-swap-space/) [\\[2\\]](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/do-we-really-need-swap-modern-systems) [\\[3\\]](https://chrisdown.name/2018/01/02/in-defence-of-swap.html) if you're worried about SSD writes I'll show you how to reduce swappiness or turn off swapping (not recommended) so you can use swap for just hibernation.\n* For hibernation to work you **need** a swap, I'll show you how to enable hibernation for a swap partition and leave the swap file [Arch Wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate#Hibernation_into_swap_file).\n* People using LVM2 I left a separate guide as it's slightly different.\n* Swap files on btrfs are also different I'll leave the [Arch Wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate#Hibernation_into_swap_file_on_Btrfs).\n* Suspend should work without configuring anything, I'll show you how to fix it if it doesn't work properly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo enable hibernation run **sudo blkid** and grab the swap partitions **\"UUID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"**\n\nNext add **resume=UUID=xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx** as a kernel parameter to your boot loader here is the [Arch Wiki page for adding kernel parameters to yours](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/kernel_parameters).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**For LVM2** users run **sudo lsblk** and check where the swap partition is located.\n\nNext add **resume=/dev/YourVolumeGroup/yourLogicalVolume** as a kernel parameter to your boot loader here is the [Arch Wiki page for adding kernel parameters to yours](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/kernel_parameters).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext configure the initramfs I'll copy and paste how to configure it from the Arch Wiki since it does a better job at explaining than I can.\n\nrun **sudo nano /etc/mkinitcpio.conf**\n\n* From Arch Wiki **\"When an initramfs with the base hook is used, which is the default, the resume hook is required in /etc/mkinitcpio.conf.

Thermald (Intel Only)\n\n* Thermald prevents throttling, if you feel your laptop won't throttle you don't have to install this, I still recommend it as a \"just in case\".\n* From Arch Wiki **\"thermald is a Linux daemon used to prevent the overheating of Intel CPU's. This daemon monitors temperature and applies compensation using available cooling methods.\"**\n* From Arch Wiki **\"By default, it monitors CPU temperature using available CPU digital temperature sensors and maintains CPU temperature under control, before hardware takes aggressive correction action.

CPU Power Management\n\n* The purpose of this CPU power saving guide isn't to just to reduce thermals it's to make the fans spin up less in turn saving battery and having a more comfortable experience. Keep in mind this can reduce performance.\n* If you want to just disable your CPU's turbo boost feature see *step 12.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor Gnome and KDE run **sudo pacman -S power-profiles-daemon** then enable it by running **sudo systemctl enable --now power-profiles-daemon** if no settings appear for setting the CPU's power profile reboot your laptop.\n\nFrom the Arch Wiki **\"power-profiles-daemon conflicts with other power management services such as** [**TLP**](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/TLP)**,** [**tuned**](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tuned) **and** [**system76-power**](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/system76-power)**.

Even though pacman keeps track of this information, it doesn't show it by default.\n\nThis can happen because of \n\n* using `pacman -R` instead of `pacman -Rs` to remove packages (dependencies stay installed)\n* makedeps stay installed after building AUR packages\n* packages removing dependencies in newer versions (without you noticing)\n\nYou can remove them by doing `pacman -Qtdq | pacman -Rns -` but check the list carefully first since  some of those packages you might actually want to keep, especially if your installation is very old.\n\nI've added all this info to the [Pacman tips: Removing unused packages](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman/Tips_and_tricks#Removing_unused_packages_\\(orphans\\)) section of the Wiki. \n\nI've also created [pacman-log-orphans-hook^[AUR]](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pacman-log-orphans-hook) which logs the list of unused packages whenever pacman runs.",

Originally meant to be a rewrite of yay, it's bound to be familiar to people of have used yay or other pacman wrapping AUR helpers.\n\nParu has seen a good amount of popularity and so far there's been 30 other contributors which I'm happy to see.\n\nThere's also been good amount of new features since the initial release. The notable ones being:\n\n- Print PKGBUILD\n- Print AUR comments\n- Print news on upgrade\n- Local repo and chroot support\n- Support for signing packages\n- Syntax highlighting with bat\n- Support for doas with `Sudo = doas` and `SudoLoop = true`\n\nI consider paru mostly feature complete at this point. The only things on my roadmap are [localization](https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru/discussions/424) and 32 bit binaries. Feel free to add to the discussion.\n\nI've also decided to set up [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Morganamilo) with some goals to see what people think and see if that goes anywhere. 5 poeple have already sponsored me so a big thank you to them.\n\nFor those interested in doing pacman/AUR things in rust. Paru is actually made up of several [libraries](https://crates.io/users/Morganamilo) which are in use in by a handful of other projects.\n\nThis includes official [rust libalpm bindings](https://github.com/archlinux/alpm.rs) for those who want to hack around with libalpm. There's also stuff for reading pacman.conf, srcinfo files, querying the AUR, downloading pkgbuilds, and dependency solving\n\nAlso friendly reminder that yes yay is still maintained. No there's not any obligation to stop using it.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention, I've created #paru on libera.chat for discussion/basic help.",

    "title": "Is Arch Linux hitting the mainstream?",
    "body": "So I've noticed that in the past \\~2 weeks two major companies have announced their utilisation of Arch Linux *(for purposes specifically related to gaming)*.\n\nThe more famous announcement was *Valve* announcing the *Steam Deck*. As many on this forum might know, the *Steam Deck* will be using Arch Linux as the base for their own Linux distribution, SteamOS, with the intention to get *every single* Windows video game on Steam working on SteamOS via *(presumably)*, Proton. This news in it of itself is quite exciting as it has the potential of further legitimising the usage of Linux distributions for playing video games hopefully encouraging developers to pay closer attention to it.\n\nThe other, *and in my opinion more interesting*, announcement was by Nvidia. [https://youtu.be/VBfci5hYN1c](https://youtu.be/VBfci5hYN1c) They made a tech demo / showcase where a MediaTek ARM CPU was being used alongside an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti to play the game Wolfenstein: YoungBlood *(an x86\\_64 Windows game)* on Arch Linux (*on an ARM CPU!!)*. You can tell it's Arch Linux from the neofetch output. This was very interesting to me. I am presuming that Nvidia compiled their own version of Arch Linux from the source code on ARM although they might've been using the Arch Linux ARM Project. This means that they, firstly, translated the game's Windows API calls to things Linux can understand (presumably through Proton or Wine or something else) and secondly, the took a game that was designed for the x86\\_64 architecture and got it running on an ARM CPU. They also managed to get an Nvidia GPU running with an ARM CPU so this means they have PCI-E and potentially UEFI? *Sidenote: Nvidia's demo was meant to explore the capabilities of using RTX Chromebooks with ARM CPUs.*\n\nThis is quite interesting indeed and I don't doubt that both companies chose to use Arch Linux due to its flexibility as an OS platform with being very customisable and having the ability to be tailored to one's requirements.\n\nWhat are your opinions on this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: What I'm seeing in the comments has led me to believe that pure Arch *(given as is by the maintainers and the download .iso on* [*archlinux.org*](https://archlinux.org)*)* might not be the one hitting mainstream, but many entities will be basing their own distro's off of Arch due to its modularity and ease of compilation / customisation. \n\nI also forgot to mention *yet another* implementation of Arch Linux, especially on ARM, the *Asahi Linux Project* which aims to get Linux up and running on Apple M1 (ARM) MacBooks claims to be using Arch Linux as the base for their distro. Now sure, it's not being backed by some large company *(probably the opposite, in fact)*, but it's also an interesting use case that further emphasises the preference of developers to use Arch Linux as the base for *\"niche\"* distro use-cases.",

    "body": "I've become a systemadmin for my roommates. They also happen to be my family members. We all moved to the states together about 10 years ago. It's a huge family and we are super tight. We occupy a floor here in this apartment building. Imagine the Home Alone family just instead of a big house it's a bunch of apartments lol.\n\nAnyway. Many of us are PC gamers, particularly the 20-30 year old generation of cousins. (My aunt and uncle had 10 children.) While I'm not exactly going to say I am a tech aficionado I'm sort of known as the \"computer\" guy, I have an IT degree (although I've never put it to real use) and I have a reputation for fixing pleb problems on my friends/family's laptops and PCs. It is usually something simple like installing Windows for them in a very \"clean\" manner, a hardware thing, or just to look for a workaround for a bug. I use Linux myself simply out of personal reasons, it's been a longtime interest of mine.\n\nThe hefty majority of use AMD computers. It wasn't until very recently that the Linux lightbulb went off  for everyone else besides me. It wasn't even to fix an issue or for any specific benefits, just an interest thing, it has quickly become part of our lives honestly. It's been happening for a while but what started really kicking things off recently was I was the only one in this age-group of my family to get access to the new Counter Strike 2 limited beta. With a small crowd of my family around me showing off Counter Strike 2, my brother remarked on how insane it was that the OS I was using to play it wasn't on Windows. That one remark snowballed. I said \"Yeah right?? It's as simple as this\" and then I opened up Steam and showed the \"Steam Play\" sections of the settings menu. \"It comes built right into Steam for Linux, it's called Proton. It pretty much can play any Windows game, besides a very small handful.\" This blew my brother's mind and became a huge talking point. He began pestering me in the most wonderful ways \"Can Linux do this\" \"Will I still be able to keep that\" pondering things and soon enough we all began talking about distros, where Arch comes in. I explained to them the difference between rolling distros and LTS/stable ones. He wasn't interested in distro/OS that \"got a new version every months or year\" I said that a rolling release gives you the benefit of a system that you install once and update forever, at the expense of having to \"stay on top of updates\", ie system maintenance. I said that this isn't really something you can just explain or learn in one sitting, it takes familiarity and experience. But it isn't \"hard\", it's as simple as the idea of being aware of what's on your system. This part went in one ear, right out the other for him 😂 We looked over at the elephant in the room, which is a nearly 7 year old Arch Linux installation on my PC, and then back at eachother. \".....yo why don't you just do it\"\n\nSo there goes my brother, now a happy Arch Linux Plasma desktop user with his newly riced out panel scheme he is obsessed with (I told him not to change too many defaults but he just kept on going lol) it was so nice and surreal to see that obsession on someone else in my family, that I'm not the only one who gets the tingles from seeing OSs that aren't Mac or Windows. He opted for KDE Plasma because of the mix of familiarity, and instant access to Freesync support for his monitor, and the sheer amount of customization. I personally use GNOME but I know that's quite a bold interface I wouldn't try to push it onto someone who doesn't seem interested. The rest of my family began to follow suit, Arch Linux and KDE and Proton became the main talking point of 2023.\n\nSara's bluetooth headphones were literally the only issue and it was because they were some weird knockoff brand from overseas. Everything else works out the box, for everyone. I swear to god I'm not exaggerating, it has been SIGNIFICANTLY less stressful to be the \"little bug fixer computer dude\" in the family, since I switched us all to Linux. I AM THE ONLY GNOME USER, EVERYONE ELSE PREFERRED PLASMA. I think that's hilarious but it is what it is lol. Friday is now update day, I go to 3 different apartments and update all the Arch installations for my family. I want to make a movie out of this or something, life is fucking awesome. The only one who hasn't boarded this bizarre penguin train is my cousin DJ. He simply doesn't want to change anything, the tried &amp; true aint-broke-don't-fix-it type. He'll come around 😎🐧",

    "body": "tl;dr: In PKGBUILD, remove `--user root` and use `chown -R root:root \"${pkgdir}\"` instead.\n\nI found that some nodejs packages were conflicting with each other months ago, but I didn't look into it and just went with `npm install -g` instead of AUR.\n\nYesterday, I met the conflict again and decided to have a look. When I saw `/usr/lib/node_modules/root/tests/index.js`, my first thought was \"oh, the tests are installed in a top-level directory shared among all nodejs packages, so they conflict\". But I soon found myself wrong: how could there be so many packages that don't conflict with each other, if they are all installed in the same directory?\n\nThen, I noticed `/usr/lib/node_modules/root/package.json`. Oops, it's [a package called \"root\"](https://www.npmjs.com/package/root). In the PKGBUILD, there was an \"option\" `--user root`, which seems to be an alternative for `chown -R root:root \"${pkgdir}\"`. But, npm doesn't accept this option [since npm v7](https://github.com/npm/cli/blame/5ae068ae57d309b2ab4bc3f34c27cd1d86bcd7b2/CHANGELOG.md#L2885). Believe it or not, npm doesn't complain about any option that it doesn't recognize. So, `--user root` does nothing but installing the package called root.\n\nThere must be many invalid packages, I thought. But guessing is useless, so I created a new directory and ran `paru -G $(paru -Ssq --aur nodejs-)`. There were 356 such packages, and 184 of them contain `--user root` in the PKGBUILD. What's more, 291 of them don't contain `chown`.\n\nAt first, I commented under many packages. But there were too many. And this somehow seems like spamming. Then I decided to adopt orphaned packages. I only chose the packages that have at least one vote and the upstream is not deprecated or unmaintained for years. The result is the title, and more details are in [my AUR repository](https://github.com/ouuan/AUR-packages).",

I'm 100% sure the password was right, after like 30 min trying to understand what was going on, it magically worked again. Anyway I just didn't care, didn't tried to see what was source of the problem and moved on.\n\nBut today it happened again, not once but twice. Same behavior again, it just doesn't accept the password, and after like 10 min it magically accepts the password again. \n\nThe only output I get is `Sorry try again`. And checking the `journalctl` I found this:\n```\npam_unix(sudo:auth): conversation failed\npam_unix(sudo:auth): auth could not identify password for [myuser]\n```\n\nThat's what `jounarlctl` shows when using sudo doesn't work. Trying to debug this I typed the password wrong on purpose to see what does `journalctl` shows. And when the password is typed wrong I get this: \n```\nmyuser : 1 incorrect password attempt ; TTY=pts/2 ; PWD=/home/myuser ; USER=root\n```\n\nAs you can see, the error message is different. It also confirms that I'm not typing my password wrong (I already was 100% sure of this).\n\nWhile I was writing this post I decided to check `journalctl` a little bit more in detail, looking for key words like *password* and *pam*. And soon enough I found hundreds of lines with the following:\n```\npam_unix(su:session): session closed for user root\n```\n\nBut also, I found just a few a lines with the same, but starting with CROND:\n\n```\nCROND[18486]: pam_unix(crond:session): session closed for user root\n```\nIn these lines the error was comming from the crond service. Long story short, the whole problem was crond failing to execute a command as root for a script I had, which caused the pam module to kick in and block sudo access everywhere for the default fail timeout period. \n\nFirst I was writing this to ask for help, but solved the problem in the middle and since I already had almost the whole post I decided to change it from asking for help, to giving an advice. Specially for new users, which I see a lot of them comming in lately. Remember! always check jurnalctl when weird things start happening, It is amazing to debug problems.",

I was working on my Arch in Library and a student in his sophomore year(2nd year) saw me using Arch and as he too was an Arch enthusiast, he got curious. So, he started asking me various questions. One of the questions that he asked was what DE environment am I using. Am I using a tiling manager or just windows-like WM. To which I answered that I don't use a tiling manager, stock KDE is fine for me. To which he replied what's the point of using Arch if you aren't using a tiling manager, stick to windows.\n\nThis statement felt very weird and dumb to me coz is he really trying to justify his usage of Arch by a WM which can be configured on any Linux Distro? There are many reasons for using Arch but tiling manager is not one of them lmao.\n\nTo the curious ones, I don't use a tiling manager because my laptop screen is only 14\" and it doesn't make sense to use a tiling manager for such a small display (for larger displays it make sense), at least according to me.\n\nAnd yeah, I didn't have time to make him understand this coz he was in a hurry.\n\n\nEdit: Ok, I was wrong, it does make sense for a tiling manager to be used on smaller display. I just never gave it much thought as I was fine with stock-KDE plasma and I didn't like dividing my display into smaller windows. (Max I like to do is use 2 application in split mode)",

My dream of working as a programmer and infrastructure engineer finally came true last year.\n\nIt hasn’t been easy but I wanted to at least come and extend my gratitude to you, the community, and Arch. I truly believe that without you it wouldn’t have been possible. \n\nThank you sincerely!\n\nI’m sure there are plenty of Arch users out there with a similar story or motivation to work in IT someday too. Inspiration fuels inspiration. Don’t forget those that help you get there and Godspeed!",

    "body": "Since I've seen people [still discussing this](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/x8h9y7/is_grub_fixed/), [mods denying](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/x8h9y7/comment/inkgmgd/) the [clear upstream bug](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2022-08/msg00374.html), and even people confused in the [arch bug report](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/75701). I've the decided to explain the problem in the best way I know how: with code.\n\nSo we have a menu:\n\n    menuentry \"1. Arch Linux\"\n    menuentry \"2. UEFI Firmware Settings\"\n\nIf we select `1` we start Arch Linux, if we select `2` we enter the UEFI firmware. The command that starts the firmware is called `fwsetup`.\n\n    case $option in\n    \t1) arch ;;\n    \t2) fwsetup ;;\n    esac\n\nNow, this works, but the second menu entry is only generated in machines with UEFI UI support which happened to have booted into UEFI mode (as opposed to legacy BIOS mode) and in August 17 GRUB developers thought it wise to always generate the menu entry regardless of how you booted when you generated the menu: [Improve logic to check for fwsetup support](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2022-08/msg00169.html).\n\nThis has the problem that if UEFI UI is not supported, the menu entry will be displayed, but it will throw an error. So somebody had the idea to decide whether or not to display the menu entry at runtime, by adding an option to `fwsetup` which already has to check for UEFI UI support anyway (to throw the error), so instead of this:\n\n    fwsetup() {\n    \techo \"Starting UEFI firmware\"\n    \techo \"REBOOTING\" &gt;&amp;2\n    \texit\n    }\n\nWe have this:\n\n    fwsetup() {\n    \tif [[ \"$1\" = --is-supported ]]; then\n    \t\ttest -n \"$efi_ui_supported\"\n    \t\treturn $?\n    \tfi\n    \n    \tif [[ -z \"$efi_ui_supported\" ]]; then\n    \t\techo \"ERROR: EFI UI not supported\" &gt;&amp;2\n    \t\treturn 1\n    \tfi\n    \n    \techo \"Starting UEFI firmware UI\"\n    \techo \"REBOOTING\" &gt;&amp;2\n    \texit\n    }\n\nNow the menus are like:\n\n    menuentry \"1. Arch Linux\"\n    \n    fwsetup --is-supported &amp;&amp;\n    menuentry \"2. UEFI Firmware Settings\"\n\nOn machines with UEFI UI support, two entries will be shown, and otherwise just one.\n\nGreat... **If** you run `grub-install` which updates the `fwsetup` command and `grub-mkconfig` which regenerates the menu.\n\nBut what happens if you only do `grub-mkconfig`? (which is run automatically in many Arch-based distros), well then your menu is going to call `fwsetup --is-supported`, which doesn't have that option, so it's going to do:\n\n    fwsetup() {\n    \techo \"Starting UEFI firmware UI\"\n    \techo \"REBOOTING\" &gt;&amp;2\n    \texit\n    }\n\nSo... While trying to display the menu GRUB is going to reboot to start the UEFI firmware UI.\n\nThis is a **BUG**. Upstream has already [acknowledged so](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2022-08/msg00374.html) and are thinking on removing the call to `fwsetup --is-supported` in the menu.\n\nBut it has not yet been fixed in upstream: [30\\_uefi-firmware.in](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/grub.git/tree/util/grub.d/30_uefi-firmware.in) is still calling `fwsetup --is-supported`, and it's not fixed in Arch Linux either. All Arch Linux maintainers did was add a note saying people need to make sure to run `grub-install`, but what if you don't read that?\n\nThe proper fix is to **revert** these changes and return to a version of [30\\_uefi-firmware.in](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/grub.git/tree/util/grub.d/30_uefi-firmware.in?id=46d76f8fef7663b60d025cd425b348029c296350) which is known to work, so before 2022-08-18. In this version `fwsetup` is only called if you select the menu entry, never otherwise.\n\nI've sent a patch to Arch Linux maintainers in yet another bug report: [FS#75862 - \\[grub\\] revert upstream bug which causes GRUB to reboot](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/75862). This way it's not necessary to call `grub-install` to make sure your system boots.\n\n**Update**: My task was closed immediately because according to Arch Linux maintainers it's a \"duplicate\" of task [FS#75701](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/75701): it's not. That task was \"fixed\" by adding a note to run `grub-install`, my task is about fixing the package properly by not requiring to run `grub-install` and thus be backwards-compatible.\n\n**Note**: There are two deviations. one in the case your UEFI doesn't have a UI, in that case if you have an old version of GRUB installed in your EFI partition, `fwsetup`  is not available and GRUB will not attempt to restart to display a non-existent UEFI firmware UI, you'll simply not see the menu entry (presumably). The second one is that if you are on a BIOS platform, I don't know what happens if you run `fwsetup` there, but I've heard that the system crashes (instead of rebooting). I also don't know what happens if you run `fwsetup --is-supported` in BIOS, even if you do `grub-install` you might have problems, another patch to avoid that [has been proposed](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2022-08/msg00384.html).\n\nHere's the full script if you want to simulate what GRUB does in different interactions:\n\n    efi_ui_supported=1\n    \n    menuentry() {\n    \techo \"$1\"\n    }\n    \n    fwsetup_1() {\n    \techo \"Starting UEFI firmware UI\"\n    \techo \"REBOOTING\" &gt;&amp;2\n    \texit\n    }\n    \n    fwsetup_2() {\n    \tif [[ \"$1\" = --is-supported ]]; then\n    \t\ttest -n \"$efi_ui_supported\"\n    \t\treturn $?\n    \tfi\n    \n    \tif [[ -z \"$efi_ui_supported\" ]]; then\n    \t\techo \"ERROR: EFI UI not supported\" &gt;&amp;2\n    \t\treturn 1\n    \tfi\n    \n    \techo \"Starting UEFI firmware UI\"\n    \techo \"REBOOTING\" &gt;&amp;2\n    \texit\n    }\n    \n    fwsetup() {\n    \tfwsetup_1 \"$@\"\n    }\n    \n    arch() {\n    \techo \"Starting Arch Linux\"\n    }\n    \n    menuentry \"1.

    "body": "I've been using M$ Windows for more than two decades. However, the user experience just got worse and worse over it's iterations, and the creepy telemetry built in Windows 10 is the dealbreaker for me. I decided once and for all to leave the DARK SIDE, and join the rank of happy penguins.\n\nThis is not my first time installing Linux. I've tried several distroes over the past decades, just out of curiosity. Ubuntu, Fedora, and openSUSE are the ones that I've tried with good CJK language support. I also tried Manjaro and MXLinux, but their CJK input method support is not functionally complete, and this is a no-go for me, as I'm Asian. Anyway, I've never used any of them long enough to replace my workflow on M$ Windows. And my skill in Linux command line was near to none, just a noob.\n\nThis time, it's for real. Initially I wanted to try using Fedora Linux for an extended period to get myself acclimated to the Linux DE, command line and workflow, as Fedora was the distro that's a little bit harder than Ubuntu, but not scarily hard. However, I have three hard drives and one SSD installed in my desktop PC, and I'd like to use three HDDs as a single LV (it wasn't too bad to use them separately under Windows as different drives). During installation, I found that there is no easy way to install the EFI and /root on the SSD, while setup a LV comprised of three HDDs and mount it correctly in Fedora's GUI installer. I found little information on this for Fedora during googling, but I found a lot of information and tutorial for Arch Linux.\n\nI've heard that Arch is an \"advanced\" distro, and thus never considered it as an option in the past. But since there are so many documents on Arch website and video tutorials on Youtube, I decided to give it a try. It surely was a little bit scary to see an black prompt rather than colorful graphical installer, but I tried to follow the documents and tutorials relevant to my scenario. So, a noob is installing Arch. Ouch! \n\nThe first installation was successful. I didn't bother try to build a LV, just installed it on a single SSD, with the simplest partition scheme and GRUB as bootloader. Just copy every step from YT tutorial videos, it's totally doable. Then I tried to use btrfs but not ext4 for root partition, and also created a LV and mounted it during installation. I was able to boot it with GRUB, but I made the swap partition too large, 8G for a system with 32G RAM, which makes no sense (of course, I reached that conclusion by more reading and watching more video tutorials.) I was a little too confident at that moment, tried another new installation with swapfile on btrfs. O boy, that was laborious and I didn't set up systemd-boot correctly, thus a total failure. GRUB was able to recognize the efi, but still hanged some point during systemd. For the fourth time, I did a btrfs install with no swap, created a LVM and mounted it, and using systemd-boot as bootloader. The fourth installation was a mixed-bag. I installed two kernels, 5.10 LTS and 5.11. I can boot with 5.10 LTS kernel and install desktop environment, but not with 5.11. 5.11 hangs during systemd, prompted me an error message of not being able to initialize LV and not being able to mount it to its mount point, then goes into emergency shell.\n\nAt this point, I've typed more commands in four days than the past two decades combined. Although I still can't figure out what is the reason that 5.10LTS kernel boots but 5.11 doesn't, but I think I'll just settle down for now as I'm too tired for another round of installation, and start using Arch Linux as my daily driver. Manually generate locale also provide CJK language input support on par with Fedora/Ubuntu/openSUSE, the three distroes with respective commercial versions. Perfect CJK support is the prerequisite of a working machine for me, and Arch delivers, since locale is generated during manual installation.\n\nOver the past two decades, I hardly learned anything of Linux from limited exposure of distroes wrapped under GUI. But just installing Arch Linux four times, at least I learned how to set up a reasonable partition scheme using command line, and gained some knowledge of what was happening under the hood of calamares.\n\nFrom this experience, I think the fastest way for a newcomer to learn the basics of Linux is simply start right away from installing Arch Linux on a simple machine with only one single SSD, but not from using \"beginner friendly\" distroes. If I could complete the same task without changing my habit from using Windows GUI for so long, I won't change that habit under Ubuntu/Manjaro.\n\nI hope the next update of kernel could magically fix the problem of dead hang during systemd init. But 5.10 LTS is doing fine for now, and that's enough for me.",

Hopefully this means more regular releases with more bugfixes!\n\n    [Approved] Plasma 6 Proposal: incubate SDDM\n    \n    Being a non-KDE project necessarily imposes more distance and loses certain opportunities for tighter integration, like the kind that GNOME has with their GDM login manager. It would be of long-term benefit to tighten integration between SDDM and Plasma to improve the UX in a way that incubation within KDE could achieve.\n    \n    At this point nearly all SDDM development comes from KDE devs anyway, so it's already sort of de facto incubated in all but name and release schedule. On that subject, being a part of presumably the Plasma release cycle would also ensure that SDDM gets regular releases, which it is desperately in need of.\n    \n    Obviously we would need to talk with the prior maintainer Pier Luigi Fiorini about this.",

    "body": "So first of all, I'm an idiot. I unironically bought a new Macbook Pro in 2017. I know, I know. I should have known better. In 2015 I daily drove Ubuntu on an old Dell laptop and that experience was less than pleasant. I walked away thinking, \"I'll keep my Ubuntu servers, but the desktop is just too much of a headache.\"\n\nFast foward to 2018. I get a once in a lifetime chance to visit a foreign country with my dad. No way I'm bringing a $2500 laptop with me, so I bought one of the 2011 Lenovo no HDD specials on eBay, threw a SSD in there, and installed Pop!_OS. Sure as hell wasn't going to run Windows.\n\nAfter we checked into a hotel, my dad asked to use the laptop to check his emails, the news, etc. He commented how nice the computer was, \"Where did you get this?\" Lol. I had to agree, it was really nice to use, and even though it was 1/10th the price of my Fruit-adjacent laptop, when I took it home, I started using it more than the other, and I thought to myself, \n\n\"I'll never buy another Mac or Windows PC again, it'll be something Linux based. I need to incrementally change my workflow now so that when that day comes, I'm ready to switch full time.\"\n\nAs nice as Pop!_OS was at the time, I thought it was important to expand my understanding of what was available, so I started distro hopping. Initially, I kept hearing people on Reddit and on various forums talk about how much they loved XFCE, so I started there with Xubuntu. I tried Mint, Ubuntu MATE, Deepin, and a few more, and started to notice everything was Ubuntu based. At the time, the other talked-up and popular distro was Manjaro, and when I tried that, everything changed for me. I had the choice between 3 different Desktop Environments out of the box. It was easy to set up graphics drivers, and change the kernel. Something about pacman I liked a lot more than apt. \n\nHere comes this year. I have 6 children and all told, 3 desktops and 3 laptops that run on Manjaro for our family to use for school and to game together. To some degree, I'm a bona-fide Manjaro fanboy at this point. But, as time went on, I started to notice some disadvantages to it, and the additional overhead of having everything done for you, which is of course a big pro in a lot of ways, but also meant all the systems came with a lot of extra configuration just to brand it as Manjaro and give it the \"Manjaro\" experience. I was longing for a more \"stock\" Arch experience, but doubted my own abilities.\n\nWell, about a year later, I gave it a try, just followed the installation guide, and darn if plain old Arch doesn't run even better than the Manjaro machines, the other nice thing was only dealing with things I had explicitly installed myself, which made configuration and debugging way easier.\n\nSo, I shouldn't have doubted myself. And, I shouldn't have doubted you either, Arch.",

Like many, I started my Linux journey with Ubuntu (version 7.10 \"Gutsy Gibbon\" - feels like a lifetime ago) and I stayed in the Debian family for many years, mostly on Linux Mint. I did distro hop and even go back to Windows for a while but always came back to the familiar ecosystem centered on dpkg and apt/apt-get/aptitude. It was only last year that I changed my daily driver to Manjaro, then EndeavourOS, and finally Arch Linux itself.\n\nI never thought apt was slow until I tried pacman. It was a hell of a lot better than managing software on Windows! Well, now it's It's been over a year since I switched but I'm still blown away by how quickly pacman installs packages. I\\`m not talking about download speeds, but the installation itself. Apart from when running dkms hooks for a new kernel, pacman installs packages amazingly fast compared to apt, which is very sluggish by comparison. What is the secret? Does it have something to do with how the packages are compressed, or is it configured to make better use of multiple cores, or something else? I really want to know. And if it's possible to be this fast, how come the apt devs haven't implemented the necessary changes to their package manager? What am I missing?",

Well expand that article!\n\nYou know how you once wanted to use that software and it didn't work, and after some forum topics you found out that one config file didn't exist some place or needed something set up. Well, share it with the rest of us!\n\nYou know how you found a way to make doing something easier with a really popular or maybe an obscure to the point of not even having a proper arch wiki article...

I must admit that I don't understand all the commands I've used, and there are so many ways to install things that some times I can't follow some tutorials and I don't even understand why (you are told to write \"X\" command that should give you certain output and I get an error :P)\n\nAll this said, it is a shame that Linux doesn't get the attention it deserves, it should be the superior platform in all areas (and in some areas is, like servers) but on the consumer side is missing support from developers, specially big ones. I hope Valve keeps pushing Linux and helps to improve gaming even more. The more people use Linux, the bigger the incentive for companies to support Linux will be.\n\nAnd I'm sorry for my comments towards Linux, it's actually cool. All this said, Windows is extremely easy compared to Linux, which I understand it makes many people hesitant of using it. In my case I've used Windows since 3.1, so I'm comfortable with it and I know how to solve most of the problems people use to have with the platform.

I ended up discovering a bug that occurs during a long lived series of interactions with an external API. The bug takes a long time to reproduce (~40 minutes). It was getting late, so I added some logging and left the application running when I went to bed. I woke up today to find that Windows had restarted itself to do more updates without my consent. It also helpfully tried to make Edge my default browser, bugged me to sign up for a Microsoft account (I have one for dev purposes already anyway, but why do I need to log in before entering my desktop environment). After I'm finally logged in, I right click on the new Edge icon on my taskbar and unpin it. The icon disappeared but left a giant blank spot behind where it had been.

    "body": "Like thousands of other applicants, I went through Canonical’s extremely long hiring process (over four months: September 2024 → February 2025) for a software engineer position.\n\n**TL;DR:** They wasted my time and cost me my current job.\n\nThe process required me to spend **tens of hours** answering pointless questions—such as my high school grades—and other irrelevant ones, plus technical assessments. Here’s the breakdown:\n\n1. **Endless forms** with useless questions that took **10+ hours** to complete.\n2. **IQ-style test** (for some reason).\n3. **Language test**—seriously, why?\n\nAfter passing those, I moved to the interview stages:\n\n1. **Technical interview** – Python coding.\n2. **Manager interview** – Career discussions (with the hiring team).\n3. **Another tech interview** – System architecture and general tech questions.\n4. **HR interview** – Career-related topics, but HR had no clue about salary expectations.\n5. **Another manager interview** (not in the hiring team).\n6. **Hiring lead interview** – Positive feedback.\n7. **VP interview** – **Very positive feedback**, I was literally told, *\"You tick all the boxes for this position.\"*\n\nEventually, I **received an offer**. Since I was already employed, I resigned to start in four weeks. Even though the salary—revealed **only after four months**—was underwhelming, it was a bit higher than my previous job, so I accepted. The emotional toll of the long process made me push forward.\n\n# And then, the disaster…\n\nOne week after accepting the offer, I woke up to an email from the hiring manager stating that, after further discussions with upper management, they had decided to cancel my application.\n\nWhat upper management? No one ever mentioned this step. And why did this happen after I received an offer?\n\nI sent a few polite and respectful emails asking for an explanation. No response. Neither from my hiring manager nor HR.\n\nNow, I’m left starting from scratch (if not worse), struggling to pay my bills.\n\n# My advice if you’re considering Canonical:\n\n* Prepare emotionally for a very long process.\n* Expect childish behavior like this.\n* Never resign until you’ve actually started working.\n\nI would never recommend Canonical to anyone I care about. If you're considering applying, I highly recommend checking Reddit and Glassdoor for feedback on their hiring process to make your own judgment.\n\nP.S. :\n\n\\- If your company is recruiting in europe, and you can share that info or refer me. please do !",

    "body": "*Brussels — April 1, 2025*\n\n\n\nIn a move that’s shaking up the tech world and raising eyebrows in Silicon Valley, the Belgian government has announced a groundbreaking new tariff: a **“Freedom Fee”** on all commercial software developed in the United States.\n\n\n\nEffective immediately, the new regulation introduces a 17.76% tax on American-made proprietary software sold or used in Belgium — a number officials insist is “purely symbolic” and definitely not a cheeky nod to US independence.\n\n\n\n“We believe in supporting software that reflects European values: openness, collaboration, and the joy of reading through thousands of lines of undocumented C code,” said Minister of Digital Affairs, Luc Verstegen, in a press conference held entirely via a LibreOffice Impress presentation. “This is not a punishment — it’s an encouragement to embrace open source. Also, Microsoft Excel crashed on us during the budget meetings.”\n\n\n\n**A Loophole for Libre**\n\n\n\nUnder the new policy, open-source software is fully exempt. Government agencies have reportedly already begun transitioning from Adobe products to GIMP and Inkscape, with mixed emotional results.\n\n\n\nPublic schools will phase out commercial learning software in favor of “whatever runs on Linux Mint,” and the Finance Ministry has proudly announced that all future taxes will now be calculated using LibreOffice Calc macros, described by one insider as “a heroic but deeply confusing experience.”\n\n\n\n**US Tech Giants Respond**\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for a major US software company, who asked not to be named (but their name rhymes with “Macrosoft”), warned that this could spark a digital trade war.\n\n\n\n“We support freedom — freedom to license, freedom to upsell, and freedom to crash during updates,” they said in a tersely worded Clippy-shaped press release.\n\n\n\n**FOSS Community Rejoices**\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, open-source developers worldwide are celebrating. GitHub has reported a spike in Belgian forks of previously dormant repos, including a sudden revival of interest in a 2003 Perl-based accounting tool named “MooseBudget.”\n\n\n\nLocal developer communities are planning a national holiday called “Libre Day,” during which Belgians will ceremonially uninstall commercial versions of antivirus software and replace them with open-source alternatives. Whether it’s a bold stand for digital sovereignty or just an elaborate April Fools’ prank with exceptional patch notes, one thing is clear: Belgium has officially ctrl-alt-deleted business as usual.\n\n\\#AprilFools #DigitalSovereignty #OpenSource #TechPolicy #GovTech #SoftwareTax #Innovation #MadeInBelgium #FOSS #DigitalTransformation #CyberHumor #LinkedInHumor #EUtech \n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaspernuyens\\_aprilfools-digitalsovereignty-opensource-activity-7312789588660355072-rohB/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=member\\_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAACO1wBefRMas4ftt\\_uS1IGBYyC\\_ziPY5k](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaspernuyens_aprilfools-digitalsovereignty-opensource-activity-7312789588660355072-rohB/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAACO1wBefRMas4ftt_uS1IGBYyC_ziPY5k)\n\n",

    "body": "Hey r/linux\n\nI wanted to share an exciting weekend project my kids and I tackled: we built a beast of a home server powered by an AMD EPYC 7C13 (3rd gen). This CPU is typically found in big cloud provider datacenters, but we managed to snag one on eBay for just $875 (MSRP is ~$7000)\n\n**Quick Benchmark Highlights:**\n\n- M.2 SSD: Achieves a blazing 7GB/sec throughput.\n- DDR4 RAM: Delivers a jaw-dropping 130GB/sec bandwidth.\n- Linux Kernel Build: Fully compiles with all options enabled in 10 minutes. (This would normally take an hour on a typical setup!)\n\nI actually did a separate post on this in r/homelab with more technical details/prices if you’re curious - https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1hmnnwg/built_a_powerful_and_silent_amd_epyc_home_server/\n\n**Part 2: We Created a Minimalist Linux Distro for It!**\n\nWe also developed and open-sourced a lightweight Linux distribution tailored for this server, called Sbnb Linux. You can check it out here: https://github.com/sbnb-io/sbnb\n\n**Why Sbnb Linux?**\n\nSbnb Linux is designed for simplicity, focusing on booting bare-metal servers and setting up remote connectivity with zero hassle using Tailscale. Even more remarkable, it comes pre-configured for Confidential Computing (AMD SEV-SNP) right out of the box. Learn more at README-CC.\n\n**How It Works:**\n\n- Write the sbnb.raw image to a USB flash drive.\n- Add your Tailscale key as plaintext to the drive.\n- Boot your server from the USB.\n- Within minutes, your server appears in your Tailscale machine list.\n- SSH to your server using Tailscale OAuth (e.g., Google Auth).\n- Bonus: With one Docker command, you can seamlessly switch Sbnb Linux to any other distro (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS, Alpine). See the https://github.com/sbnb-io/sbnb/ for details!\n\nThis combo of high-performance hardware and a minimalist OS has been incredibly satisfying to build.\n\nIf you’ve worked on something similar or have any questions about our setup, I’d be delighted to hear from you!\n\nI also extend a warm welcome to anyone interested in joining this exciting opportunity to develop a new Linux distro focused on confidential computing and resilience!",

Any posts mentioning DistroWatch and multiple groups associated with Linux and Linux discussions have either been shut down or had many of their posts removed.\n\n&gt; We've been hearing all week from readers who say they can no longer post about Linux on Facebook or share links to DistroWatch. Some people have reported their accounts have been locked or limited for posting about Linux.\n\n&gt; The sad irony here is that Facebook runs much of its infrastructure on Linux and often posts job ads looking for Linux developers.\n\n&gt; Unfortunately, there isn't anything we can do about this, apart from advising people to get their Linux-related information from sources other than Facebook. I've tried to appeal the ban and was told the next day that Linux-related material is staying on the cybersecurity filter. My Facebook account was also locked for my efforts.",

It's just...\n\nI think in the life of every Linux person (or maybe it appeals to other hobbies/passions) there comes a time, when you're just simply DONE. Done reinstalling the system every couple of weeks. Done finding the best, newest trend there is. Done spending hours and hours troubleshooting and fixing issues with your extremely customized setup. Done scouring the forums and Reddit looking for answers on why this absolute newest, bleeding edge RC kernel is causing you problems. Just DONE.\n\nI've been distrohopping since I can remember. I had a brief year of using Arch (but not really, I was hopping between all Arch-based distros), then about a year or two using Fedora, but still trying out everything new that was coming out. I was in awe with all the new and shiny.\n\nBut now I'm in my 30s. I don't have time, nor headspace to wonder if my system will boot today, if the update won't break anything, if this new kernel won't cause me some weird, unexplainable issues. My OS has to boot and get out of my way. It's my terminal to the work, not my work.\n\nSo here I am. Writing this on Waterfox (basically Firefox ESR) from Linux Mint 22.1 with LTS kernel, installed on absolutely ridiculously powerful gaming machine. Do I care if I don't get new bells and whistles that come with newer kernels, newer DE versions, newer Firefox releases? No. I absolutely do not. I value the fact, that in about a year of having this Mint installation, I have NEVER had to reinstall it or fix anything. It just works. I feel no incentive to change anything here. I even use the default theming.\n\nSo, what's your story? Am I the only one, who came up to this mindset? Or maybe there are more of us? I leave the comments to you.\n\n  \nEDIT: I see there's a confusion. \"Why would you have to reinstall every couple of weeks?! Just learn to use Linux!\"  \nGuys... I'm working as sysadmin for 8 years, I know how to use Linux :P I didn't HAVE TO or NEED to reinstall my system. I just WANTED TO. To try new distro, new DE, new function, change something in my life. It was purely for fun and games. But I don't have time, nor headspace for this anymore, so I don't do this.

It's an infinite, whiteboard desktop app written in Qt/C++.\n  \n## Motivation\nLinux has had some apps with whiteboard features, like Xournal++ and Lorien. However, they have issues such as not having an infinite canvas (Xournal++) or lacking enough features (Lorien). That's why I decided to build Drawy, especially for Linux users. It's similar to Excalidraw but runs natively on your desktop, making it fast and lightweight. It's still in the alpha stage, but I have implemented key features that everyone needs:\n- Basic tools like pen, rectangle, ellipse, line, arrow, and text\n- Wacom tablet support with pressure sensitivity\n- An infinite canvas\n- Undo/redo support\n- Save/load files\n\nEven though this seems very basic, it took an enormous amount of effort to develop. Drawy is still very stable to use (I've used it a lot to teach my students!)\n\n## GitHub\nThe project is completely open source and licensed under the GNU General Public License V3. You can find the source code here: https://github.com/Prayag2/drawy\n\n## Support\nIf you liked this project, please consider supporting me!  \n- [LiberaPay](https://liberapay.com/Prayag/donate)\n- [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/O5O1FJ70D)\n- [PayPal](https://coindrop.to/prayagjain)\n",

This tool is critical for users with certain motor disabilities who can move a cursor but cannot perform clicking actions.\n\n## How I Personally Navigate Computers\n\nMy own computer usage depends entirely on assistive technology:\n\n- I use a Quha Zono 2 (a gyroscopic air mouse) to move the cursor\n- My dwell clicker software simulates mouse clicks when I hold the cursor still \n- I rely on an on-screen keyboard for all text input\n\nThis combination allows me to use computers without traditional mouse clicks or keyboard input. XLib provides the crucial functionality that makes this possible by allowing software to capture mouse location and programmatically send keyboard and mouse inputs. It also allows me to also get the cursor position and other visual feedback. If you want an example of how this is done, [pyautogui has a nice class that demonstrates this](https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui/blob/master/pyautogui/_pyautogui_x11.py).\n\n## The Issue with Wayland\n\nWhile I've successfully implemented this accessibility tool on Windows, MacOS, and X11-based Linux, Wayland has presented significant barriers that effectively make it unusable for this type of assistive technology.\n\nThe primary issues I've encountered include:\n\n- Wayland's security model restricts programmatic input simulation, which is essential for assistive technologies\n- Unlike X11, there's no standardized way to inject mouse events system-wide\n- The fragmentation across different Wayland compositors means any solution would need separate implementations for GNOME, KDE, etc.\n- The lack of consistent APIs for accessibility tools creates a prohibitive development environment\n- Wayland doesn't even have a quality on-screen keyboard yet, forcing me to use X11's \"onboard\" in a VM for testing\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nFor users who rely on assistive technologies like me, this effectively means Wayland-based distributions become inaccessible. While I understand the security benefits of Wayland's approach, the lack of consideration for accessibility use cases creates a significant barrier for disabled users in the Linux ecosystem.\n\n## The Hard Truth\n\nI developed this program specifically to finally make the switch to Linux myself, but I've hit a wall with Wayland. If Wayland truly is the future of Linux, then nobody who relies on assistive technology will be able to use Linux as they want—if at all.\n\nThe reality is that creating quality accessible programs for Wayland will likely become nonexistent or prohibitively expensive, which is exactly what I'm trying to fight against with my open-source work. I always thought Linux was the gold standard for customization ~~and accessibility~~, but this experience has seriously challenged that belief.\n\nDoes the community have any solutions, or is Linux abandoning users with accessibility needs in its push toward Wayland?",

This attitude can manifest as a dismissive or condescending behavior towards new or less experienced users or even experienced users who likes to use GUIs or simpler distros like Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Fedora, and preferring CLIs and more technically demanding setups that requires you to compile all programs from source.\n\nAs far as I can tell, Linus Torvalds isn't an elitist and Linux elitists would probably not like him too, since he admits to not using Debian, Arch, or Gentoo because he prefers distributions that are easier to install and configure. In an interview, he mentioned that he doesn't like Linux distros that are hard to install and configure, as he wants a distro that just works out of the box so he can move on with his life and focus on kernel development. He has stated that he never installs \"hard\" distros like Debian, Arch or Gentoo, which is known for its requirement to compile all programs from source. Torvalds prefers Fedora, which he uses on most of his computers, as it has been fairly good for supporting PowerPC and keeps things easy to install and reasonably up-to-date. He also appreciates Ubuntu for making Debian more user-friendly.\n\nThis makes me feel better about myself. I've been a Linux user since 2012, and I don't know how to compile programs from source and I prefer GUI over Terminal for much of my day to day life. Just like Linus, I just want a Linux distro that works out of the box and gives me no headaches to set up.",

    "body": "My story with mobile linux started a decade ago when i was roughly 18, and I was getting into linux and mentioned to my friend that \"I wish I had linux on a phone\", and they mentioned SailfishOS. Back then I didn't even know english, had no money, and the only SFOS (sailfishos shortened) available was released year ago Jolla Phone.\n\nSo how do I get my hand on SFOS? Well the only option was to port it to my phone. Action of porting is adjusting OS to a device so that every feature works, unlike desktop, where thanks to ACPI and drivers and generalized hardware stuff generally just works. Phones are not really generalized hardware and each has its quirks so it needs a wee bit of work.\n\nSo I've acquired, then vastly uninteresting Motorola Moto G2, back when Motorola was under Google. And with my trash english in hand and my motorola in other I went to #sailfishos-porters on freenode IRC.\n\nNow up till this point I've had quite an experience flashing custom ROMs on my old htc explorer. So I went to IRC and started porting sfos with help of very nice and very helpful people there.\n\nNow fast forward cause I don't want this to be too long, I've ported g2, then went to port nexus 7, moto x2, moto x force, huawei p8 lite, moto z, moto x, moto x play, moto x pro, moto g2 LTE, moto g3, fxtec pro1 asus zenfone 5z, 8, and recently oneplus 6 and xiaomi pad 6. Yeah, I've been busy.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lhy6m920p4lf1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b65fafc5514dec873d1f40cc3715a7f5542550f2\n\nBeside doing more ports than Jolla (SailfishOS owner) at the time, I've been studying software engineering and decided to make an app, then another, and another. Currently I've developed 10 apps, and as of today I'm supporting 6 devices, including Motorola moto G2 from a decade ago. Yes its still alive. Yes I'm still using it daily. Some of my apps worth noting are youtube client and telegram client. Youtube client people praise to be better than android/ios ones.\n\nPeople when talking about mobile linux just tend to flat out ignore the biggest alternative to android/IOS we have to date like it never even existed which is very weird, and tad annoying. Some people say that \"SailfishOS is proprietary\" but no, no it's not. I couldn't have contributed to it if it was closed source don't you think? Yes, it's partially proprietary but in places you wouldn't even notice. All the OS part and hardware adaptation is \\*opensource, thanks to that, other OSs like ubuntu touch or mobian or halium could exist, because people forgot where libhybris comes from, and it comes from Sailfishos. The only closed source parts is the gui and in very small amount because all libraries surrounding it are opensource. It's quite difficult to come across something closed source.\n\nNow I said \"biggest alternative to android/IOS to date\", this is true. People who have been in this space for as long as I've been know that. SailfishOS is the oldest one, and has the most amount of apps, AND they're most polished. Second place on the podium would've been taken by ubuntu touch, as its also using libhybris and it has many apps but ecosystem is not as great as SailfishOS. Then is the rest of small fries but pmos as a project to port mainline kernel would probably take a third spot. But libhybris is way faster and way easier to achieve compatibility.\n\nSo ye, if you read all that, thanks, now AMA. I'll be here all day (+- next 12h)",

And I decided to switch to it only because I was given permission to work on a project using my personal laptop (because office laptop had some technical issues and I wasn't going to get one for a month) and I didn't wanted to take risk so I installed Ubuntu as the Stack we use is well supported on Ubuntu only.\n\nAnd damn I was so wrong about Ubuntu! Everything just worked out of the box. No driver issues, every packege I can imagine is available in the repos and all of them work seemlessly. I found Snaps to be better than Flatpaks because Apps like Android Studio and VS Code didn't work out of the box as Flatpaks (because of absurd sandboxing) but I faced no issues at all with Snaps. I also found that Ubuntu is much smoother and much more polished than any distro I have used till now. \n\nI really love the Ubuntu experience so far, and I don't understand the community's irrational hate towards it.",

    "body": "I've seen a lot of Windows users who have given Linux a shot be confused, annoyed or generally critical of the fact that Windows has a scattered file system where a package will generally install stuff \"all over the place\" instead of in a simple neat directory. Ideally, programs install their static files: .exe's, .dll's and resources; in `C:\\Program Files` , user files in `%APPDATA%` and some small global config in the registry. It's a little more complicated in practice, but that's generally the gist of it. This system does have some advantages. It makes it really easy for a particular program to be installed on a different drive for example. So it does make sense why Windows users would be taken aback by the scattered file system of Linux, where programs have files seemingly all over the place.\n\nAnd so I wanted to make this post to outline what all of the directories in the Linux file system are, why they exist, and what advantages this design has over \"one program &lt;-&gt; one package\" design. It should hopefully also serve as an overview for new Linux users looking to learn more about their system. At least, it will be a post I can link to others if I ever need it.\n\n**Chapter I -- what's in** `/`\n\n**Chapter Ia -- system file directories**\n\nThese are directories where system files live.\n\nIn the traditional Linux view, the \"system\" basically means \"your package manager\". So this includes the core system components and programs installed through your package manager (be it apt on Debian/Ubuntu, dnf on RHEL/Fedora or pacman on Arch). There is no difference real between \"system files\" and \"program files\" on Linux when the programs are installed as packages. The \"base\" system, the one you get right after install, is just a bunch of packages, with many \"spins\" (Fedora KDE, Xubuntu etc.) basically being just different sets of packages to install as base.\n\nUsers do not generally do not write files here, but they read or execute them all the time -- programs, fonts, etc.\n\nThe directories are:\n\n* `/usr` \\-- static files (binaries, libraries, resources, fonts, etc.)\n* `/var` \\-- dynamic files (logs, databases, etc.)\n* `/etc` \\-- configuration files\n* `/boot` \\-- boot files\n\nThe reason these are all different directories? Well, you might want to put each of them on different partitions, or only some of them, or have all of them on the same partition, depending on your use case.\n\nFor example, you may want to mount `/usr` and/or `/etc` as read only after configuring your system to harden it. You may want to share `/etc` around multiple systems that should be configured identically. You may want to only backup `/etc` and `/var` since `/usr` and `/boot` can be easily recreated by the package manager.\n\nThese are not only theoretical use cases. The desktop distro I use is a version of Fedora Immutable, in which `/usr` is mounted as read-only, `/var` is mounted as read-write and `/etc` is mounted as an overlay filesystem, allowing me to modify it, but also allowing me to view what changes I made to system configuration and easily revert if needed.\n\n`/boot` is kept separate because it sometimes needs to be separate, but not always. A use case for this (not the only one) is what I use: most of my disk is encrypted, so `/boot` is a separate, unencrypted partition, so the kernel can launch from there and decrypt the rest of my disk after asking me for the password.\n\n**Chapter Ib -- user file directories**\n\nThese are the directories where users can store files and the package manager will not touch (but other system utilities may touch).\n\nThese directories are:\n\n* `/home` \\-- the home directories of users\n* `/root` \\-- the home directory of the root user (the administrator account)\n* `/srv` \\-- files to be served\n\nThese are pretty self-explanatory. `/root` is not a sub-directory of home because it's actually more something between a system directory and a user directory. Package managers will sometimes touch it.\n\nMoreover, if you have a bunch of Linux servers that share user lists and have `/home` mounted on the network (allowing the user to log into any server and see their files), the `/root` home should still be per-server.\n\n`/srv` is just a convenient place to store files, such as those shared via FTP, HTTP, or any other files you need to store that is not just \"a user's files\". It's entirely unstructured. No tools that I know of create directories here without being told to, so it's a nice place to just put stuff on a server. Not very useful on a desktop.\n\n**Chapter Ic -- temporary mount points**\n\nThese are mostly empty directories (or directories of empty directories) made for mounting partitions, removable drives, .ios's etc. that would not make sense anywhere else in a filesystem -- usually temporarily\n\nThese directories are:\n\n* `/mnt` \\-- for manual mounting\n* `/media` \\-- for automatic mounting of removable media\n\nYou generally do not need to worry about `/mnt` unless you are doing some command line work. Same for `/media`, if you just insert a USB stick, it'll be mounted here, but you'll also get a GUI icon to click on that will take you here, you don't generally have to manually navigate here.\n\n**Chapter Id -- virtual file systems**\n\nThese are directories who's contents don't \"actually exist\" (on disk). One of Linux's great strengths, especially from a developer perspective, is that everything is a file, be it a real one on disk, or a virtual one. Programs that can write to a file, can also write to virtual files, be they disks, terminal windows or device control files.\n\nThese directories are:\n\n* `/run` and `/tmp` \\-- temporary files stored in RAM\n* `/proc` and `/sys` \\-- low level process and system information respectively\n* `/dev` \\-- device files\n\nNow, you can safely ignore `/proc` and `/sys` as a regular user. When you open the GUI ~~Task Manager~~ System Monitor, the GUI System Monitor will read from these places, but you don't need to do so manually.\n\nThe `/run` and `/tmp` files are in-RAM places for temporary files. The reason there are two is historical and I won't go into it.\n\n`/dev` is where all of the devices are represented. You will be exposed to this when you, for example, flash a USB stick, and the flashing utility will allow you to select `/dev/sdb` (SATA drive B) to flash to. Hopefully, you will also get a user-friendly name (\"Kingston DataTraveller 32GB) next to it.\n\n**Chapter Ie -- the** `/opt` **directory**\n\nThere are some cases where programs do want to be installed in a Program Files manner with a huge directory of stuff. This is either stuff that was lazily ported, or stuff with a lot of data (100GB Vivado installs). \n\nThis is what the `/opt` directory is for.\n\nThe package manager will generally not touch it, but graphical installers of proprietary software may default to this place.\n\nIn the case of large installs, it also makes it easier to put some of the sub-directories of `/opt`, or the entire thing, on a separate drive/partition. It also allows large installs to be networked mounted, in the case of many small computers using proprietary software from a local NFS server.\n\n**Chapter II -- the structure of** `/usr`\n\n**Chapter IIa -- the useful sub-directories of** `/usr` **that will always be there**\n\nThese directories are:\n\n* `/usr/bin` \\-- executable meant to be run by users\n* `/usr/lib` \\-- shared libraries (dll's) (see bellow)\n* `/usr/share` \\-- non-executable resource files\n\nThe reason libraries are all together is that each binary is generally dynamically linked, so if the same library is used by 10 different executables, it exists only once in the system.\n\nThe reason binaries are all together is so that the shell can search in one place for all of them.\n\n**Chapter IIb -- the less useful or situational sub-directories of** `/usr` **that will usually always be there**\n\nThese directories are:\n\n* `/usr/src` \\-- sources for packages on the system, generally installed by special `*-src` packages, usually empty or almost empty\n* `/usr/include` \\-- stuff for C programming. Should arguably be a sub-directory to `/usr/share`, but hey, C is the big daddy and gets special privileges\n* `/usr/games` \\-- name is self explanatory. No, this directory is not used today. It's a relic.\n\n**Chapter IIc -- the** `/usr/lib` **debacle**\n\n`/usr/lib` is meant to hold shared libraries (32-bit and 64-bit if multilib is supported) and also \"executable resources\" of packages. The major distros do not agree on where to put each of these things.\n\nOn Debian/Ubuntu we have:\n\n* `/usr/lib/&lt;package&gt;` \\-- executable resources not meant to be run directly by users\n* `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` \\-- 64-bit libraries\n* `/usr/lib/i686-linunx-gnu` \\-- 32-bit libraries\n\nOn Red Hat/Fedora we have:\n\n* `/usr/lib` \\-- 32-bit libraries\n* `/usr/lib64` \\-- 64-bit libraries\n* `/usr/libexec` \\-- executable resources not meant to be run directly by users\n\nOn Arch we have:\n\n* `/usr/lib` \\-- 64-bit libraries\n* `/usr/lib32` \\-- 32-bit libraries\n* `/usr/libexec` \\-- executable resources not meant to be run directly by users\n\n**Chapter IId -- the** `/usr/sbin` **debacle**\n\n`/usr/sbin` is a directory meant for binaries that are not meant to be run by users, but only by administrators and such. It's kind of a relic of the past, and Fedora has moved to replace `/usr/sbin` with a link to `/usr/bin` (it's that way on my system)\n\n**Chapter IIe -- the** `/bin`/`/lib` **debacle**\n\nBack in the olden days, there used to be a difference between the core system that lived on `/` and the fat system that lived on `/usr`. This is a relic of the past. For backwards compatibility, the following links exist:\n\n* `/bin -&gt; /usr/bin`\n* `/sbin -&gt; /usr/sbin`\n* `/lib -&gt; /usr/lib`\n* `/libexec -&gt; /usr/libexec` (on Red Hat/Fedora and Arch)\n* `/lib64 -&gt; /usr/lib64` (on Red Hat/Fedora)\n* `/lib32 -&gt; /usr/lib32` (on Arch)\n\n**Chapter IIf --** `/usr/local`\n\nA copy of all the directories described above exist under `/usr/local` (eg. `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/local/lib`). This exists for packages that maintain the standard bin, lib, share structure, so would not fit in /opt. but are installed by the admin user manually and not through the package manager.\n\nThis is to avoid conflicts and unwanted overwrites. Most source packages (eg. what you find on GitHub) default to installing here after compilation.\n\n**Chapter III -- the structure of** `~`\n\n**Chapter IIIa -- the wild wild** `.west`\n\nPrograms need to store per-user data and they will generally do this in the user's home. This is `/home/bob`, `$HOME` or just `~`.\n\nNow, back in the olden days they did this with no real structure. In Linux, directories that start with a dot are \"hidden\", so they would just throw some directory in the home and store everything there: `~/.vim`, `~/.steam`, `~/.ssh`, etc.\n\n**Chapter IIIb -- the XDG directory system**\n\nRecently, an effort has been made to standardize the places programs put user files. This system mirrors the system hierarchy, but uses more modern naming for things.\n\n* `~/.local/share` \\-- equivalent to `/usr/share`\n* `~/.local/state` \\-- partially equivalent to `/var`; for program state\n* `~/.local/bin` \\-- equivalent to `/usr/bin`\n* `~/.config` \\-- equivalent to `/etc`\n* `~/.cache` \\-- partially equivalent to `/var`; for temporary files too big to store in RAM\n* `/run/user/&lt;uid&gt;` \\-- in RAM temporary files\n\nMore details [here](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/).\n\n**Chapter IIIc -- flatpaks**\n\nFlatpaks are containerized desktop apps. Flatpak stores it's data in `~/.var`",

Poor wife. \n\nI have been meaning to get into Linux for years, and in the past did try Ubuntu and Mint, but stayed away due to gaming and I worked in desktop support, predominately for Windows (and some old IBM tech but not relevant). So it made sense to stay on Windows.\n\nRecently though it has been to the point where everything has been going wrong on Windows, slow down in games, buggy boots, high temps etc. I have been spending half my spare time trying to fix it. I am meant to be the guy who breaks things, not the things breaking themselves.

I never watched him until he moved to Japan, then his videos had a vibe so I watch them now and again, and it came up on recommended. Don't judge me.\n\nImmediately after I set up a dual boot on my laptop with Fedora KDE. He put me off arch and gnome/cinnamon at the same time.\n\nSo for the last week I have been tinkering, playing around. Thinking I am smarter than I am.

How I refused to follow a guide to fix the issue, but still did. How I nuked the system again doing stupid stuff. Again, poor wife. I even took time to explain my knowledge and history with linux to her (you don't understand anything until you can explain it to someone else has always been my mind set).\n\nShe has mentioned the fact that she never wanted to hear the word Linux again (more than once).

Install **Heroic** (also in your store) and you’re set.\n* Retro gaming? You’ve got emulators for pretty much anything - PS1, PS2, PS3, GameCube, SNES, Xbox, you name it - all right there in your distro's store.\n* Steam Deck, SteamOS.\n* DXVK, VKD3D, Vulkan and Proton are improving all the time.\n* And also tools like MangoHud for hardware info.\n* There are even distros made just for gaming, like **Bazzite**.\n\nEven some big tech influencers are making videos about Linux gaming now. So Basically… gaming on Linux in 2025 is awesome. And I just love how good it has become.\n\n**EDIT:** Some people here are misunderstanding the point of this post. It’s meant to be a celebration of what Linux is right now as a gaming platform - and it’s actually a very good one. At no point am I saying it’s better than Windows or making any direct comparisons.

At home, I said \"I want to play my video games with no problems more than I want to get rid of everything terrible about windows\"\n\nAnd so my windows setup has grown, with one customization app after another. Synergy, to share mouse and keyboard among my various computers/monitors. DisplayFusion, to wrest some vestige of control from the tyranny of explorer and its awful edge-pushing, heavy handed, \"your grandma should be able to use this\" oriented approach to UI. Endless struggles trying to implement custom keyboard shortcuts for everything I want.\n\nHell no, these last few months as I semi-retired and started coding as a full time hobby, it became too much. I dipped my toe with a distro that looked and acted like windows, then said \"why don't I just set it up like I really want?\". And now I can't stop scrolling through r/unixporn.\n\nI'm sure in no time, I will have my desktop environment setup and be entirely satisfied with it, just like all of you guys.\n\nRight?\n\n...Right?\n\n—edit:\n\nThank you guys, I have read all of the comments, learned some new things, replied to some of you.

    "body": "Hi. \n\nAs you may know, Cisco have banned users from Russia, Belarus, Iran and the occupied Ukrainian territories from accessing their services. What's awkward is that they have a special relationship with the open source implementation of h.264 OpenH264—they distribute the binaries that users would otherwise have to pay for (even to compile!), and quite a lot of projects end up relying on it. \n\nThis leads to a very weird situation. Take, for example, the LocalSend app. It relies on the GNOME runtime. The GNOME runtime needs OpenH264. Flatpak tries fetching the binary for it from Cisco, but they respond with 403. \n\nThis means that for anybody in those territories (or really GeoIP'd as those territories), you essentially CANNOT use any Flatpak that relies on GNOME without a VPN. There's no mirroring, there are no attempts to mitigate this, Flatpak just *is* broken.\n\nSure, you might say that there are some weird ways by which you may block the OpenH264 from being downloaded, but who's to say that dependency management won't get stricter in the future. Sure, currently these sorts of problems are limited to a few places, but they very well could be expanded anywhere the US desires, or Cisco's servers could just die for no reason and break Flatpak with them. \n\nSo here I wonder, is there anything that could be done here? Could Flathub at least mirror the binaries? Or is there a policy of simply not caring if something breaks because of a hidden crutch? \n\nPS: This also extends to Fedora which fetches OpenH264 from Cisco's repo in much the same way. ",

    "body": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'd like to share an open-source project I've been working on called **TmuxAI**.\n\nThere are quite a few great CLI AI tools out there already. So, why build another one? My goal with TmuxAI was to create something that feels more like a human collaborator sitting next to you, specifically within the `tmux` environment you already use.\n\n**The Core Idea: Human-Inspired Observation**\n\nInstead of requiring you to pipe output, start a special subshell, or replace your terminal, TmuxAI takes a different approach:\n\n1. **It Observes:** TmuxAI reads the visible content across your panes in the current tmux window. It sees what you see.\n2. **It Understands Context:** Based on what it observes, it tries to understand what you're doing, just like a colleague looking over your shoulder.\n3. **It Interacts:** You chat with it in a dedicated pane, and it can execute commands (with your permission) in another pane.\n\n**Why is this different?**\n\nThis \"observation\" approach means TmuxAI can potentially assist you without interrupting your existing session or workflow.\n\n* **No need to leave your current task:** Are you deep in a mysql shell, debugging on a remote server via ssh, or configuring network equipment through its specific CLI? TmuxAI can still see the text in that pane and offer help based on it, because it's just reading the screen content. You don't have to exit your interactive session to ask the AI about it.\n* **Works with your existing tools:** It doesn't force you into a specific wrapper or environment. You keep using your preferred shells, editors, and tools within tmux.\n\nThink of it less as a command-line utility you call explicitly for one-off tasks, and more as an assistant that lives alongside you in your tmux window, aware of the broader context visible across your panes.\n\nIt has features like different modes (Observe, Prepare, Watch) and context management, but the core philosophy is this non-intrusive, observational assistance.\n\n**Links**\n\n* **GitHub (Code, Full README, Installation, Issues):** [https://github.com/alvinunreal/tmuxai](https://github.com/alvinunreal/tmuxai)\n* **Website (Screenshots etc):** [https://tmuxai.dev](https://tmuxai.dev/)\n\nIt's still evolving, and I'd be really grateful for any feedback from fellow tmux users. Does this approach resonate? Do you see potential use cases or have suggestions?\n\nThanks for checking it out!",

    "body": "Recently, just before Christmas, I decided to check out Linux again (tried it ~20 years ago) because Windows 11 was about to cause an aneurysm.\n\nI was expecting to spend the \"weekend\" getting everything to work; find hardware drivers, installing various open source software and generally just 'hack together something that works'.\n\nTo my surprise everything worked flawlessly first time booting up. I had WiFi, sound, usb, webcam, memory card reader, correct screen resolution. I even got battery status and management! It even came with a nice litte 'app center' making installation of a bunch of software as simple as a click!\n\nAnd I remember thinking any Windows user could _easily_ install Linux and would get comfortable using it in an afternoon.\n\nI'm pretty 'comfortable' in anything PC and have changed boot orders and created bootable things since the early 90's and considered that part of the installation the easiest part.\n\nHowever, most people have never heard about any of them, and that makes the two steps seem 'impossible'.\n\nI recently convinced a friend of mine, who also couldn't stand Window11, to install Linux instead as it would easily cover all his PC needs. \n\nAnd while he is definitely in the upper half of people in terms of 'tech savvyness', both those \"two easy first steps\" made it virtually impossible for him to install it. \n\nHe easily managed downloading the .iso, but turning that iso into a bootable USB-stick turned out to be too difficult. But after guiding him over the phone he was able to create it.\n\nBut he wasn't able to get into bios despite all my attempts explaining what button to push and when\n\nNext day he came over with his laptop. And just out of reflex I just started smashing the F2 key (or whatever it was) repeatingly and got right into bios where I enabled USB boot and put it at the top at the sequence.\n\nAfter that he managed to install Linux just fine without my supervision.\n\nBut it made me realise that the two first steps in installing Linux, that are second nature to me and probably everyone involved with Linux from people just using it to people working on huge distributions, makes them virtually impossible for most people to install it.\n\nI don't know enough about programming to know of this is possible:\n\nInstead of an .iso file for download some sort of .exe file can be downloaded that is able to create a bootable USB-stick and change the boot order?\n\nThat would 'open up' Linux to _significantly_ more people, probably orders of magnitude..",

Let me make my position clear, that Lenovo is lying through their teeth just like they did with Superfish malware incident. They lied until they couldn't lie anymore. Linux should not have to support the RAID mode because the mode should be able to be changed to AHCI, which is fully compatible with Linux, by the user in about 20 seconds. \n\nIf, by some chance, some Very Smart People ever figure out a way to make the SSD visible again, I would STRONGLY advise never upgrading the laptop's firmware again, lest Microsoft and Lenovo find something else to break and then tell us \"Oops.

Have we told you about our 360 hinge?\".\n\nI believe that if Linux ever gains driver support for the forced fake RAID configuration, that future laptops from Lenovo will just toggle something else so Linux doesn't work on them for a while.\n\nI would strongly advise avoiding the Yoga 910 and Yoga Book when they come out until we find out whether they broke those models as well.\n\nEven if your intent is to never run Linux, Lenovo is the first PC maker I've seen that ships computers that you can't even realistically (for the average user) reinstall Windows on. I will _never_ buy another Lenovo computer again and I will advise others to avoid them whenever the chance arises. I had to spend about an hour googling random support topics before I found a recommendation to use Universal Extractor to get their Windows storage driver to use in a Windows installation thumb drive. Then I had to find a beta version of Universal Extractor that supported the archive format in the setup program just to dig the Intel RST driver out of their godawful installer so that I can slipstream it into a Windows installer.\n\nMost people will have to pay to ship it back to Lenovo if Windows needs to be reinstalled, and will be unable to use the computer for weeks, and it'll probably have some sensitive, confidential, work-related information on the SSD that someone at Lenovo could copy and steal while it's in their repair center.\n\nTheir arrogant forum moderator \"Andy_Lenovo\" posted Lenovo's ridiculous press release to their forum and then marked it as solved. The only part of it that is true is that Linux will likely never be able to install on Yoga laptops, because they are \"designed for Windows 10\", which in my experience has been unstable and full of bugs (like updates stalling out requiring manual installation from offline packages, telling me to reboot everytime I pair my bluetooth headphones, etc.). Unfortunately, in addition to Lenovo and Microsoft's lies, Matthew Garrett wrote some more horsefeathers when he blamed Linux for not supporting a storage mode that shouldn't even be in use anyway. He apparently has a long record of apologizing for Microsoft and misleading people, and it's a shame that he's in the FSF. Of course, the FSF has put some other people in high places that have proceeded to undermine their mission in the past, like Miguel de Icaza.\n\nMaybe it's true that you need \"special drivers\" to make Windows run, but Microsoft doesn't care. It breaks Linux on Lenovo laptops and then makes it look like the problem is in Linux, when it's actually in Microsoft's storage driver and Microsoft is undoubtedly leaning on Intel to keep the way the RST driver does power management a secret.\n\nTo make sure that you don't accidentally buy a Signature Edition computer, on the demo model, click the start (Windows logo) button, click \"about your PC\", and under Windows 10 it will say \"Signature Edition\" if it's part of this program. Also, if you do buy a laptop to see if Linux supports it, then make sure you try installing Linux before the return period expires. If the Linux installer in Live mode can't see your SSD, stop. Unplug the thumb drive, turn the computer off, and I would recommend that you return it. Just tell the store that you decided that you didn't need it or something. It's true.. Nobody needs this kind of aggravation.\n\nEND of my response to Lenovo and Microsoft.\n\n(You do not need to ask for my permission to repost this response in its entirety anywhere else, in hard copy, or on a website.)\n\n----\n\n\n\nI got a reply from Lenovo on my Best Buy review about why the BIOS on my Yoga 900 ISK2 UltraBook has been set to stop people from using Linux.\n\n---\nLenovo Product Expert\nSeptember 20, 2016\nThis system has a Signature Edition of Windows 10 Home installed. It is locked per our agreement with Microsoft.\n---\n\nThis is related to the discussion going on Lenovo's forum's about why the SSD is locked in a proprietary RAID mode that Linux doesn't understand. Laptops known to be affected include the Yoga 900 ISK2, Yoga 900S, and Yoga 710S, which all have the same issue according to posts I've read on Lenovo's Linux forum. I was also told in a PM that the 13ISK for Business has the same issue.\n\nhttps://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206 - The forum thread for the Yoga 900 ISK2 -UPDATE - The forum thread on Lenovo's website is back up. It was deleted for a while, but now they've re-posted it in a locked state. *sigh*\n\nHere is Google's cache of the forum in case it disappears again: https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:abMCb7w2uAoJ:https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=za\n\nI'm told that CataclysmZA is backing this up in the Wayback Machine. I want to thank them for this, since this is probably Lenovo's attempt at a late night shredding party before the news can pick up the story. (Update: Posted at the bottom.\n\nUpdate: The Lenovo employee posted about locking the thread. Basically, he called me disruptive and then said that if they had to, they would turn on pre-approval so that nobody can comment anywhere on their support forum until they've read it and have made sure it won't embarrass them. Nice, huh? Don't address the issue. Don't say anything about whether the problem will be fixed. Don't re-open the thread. Just threaten and bully people with the \"We can make sure your posts are never seen.\" option.\n\nhttps://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Installing-Ubuntu-16-04-on-Yoga-900S/td-p/3336715 - The thread for the problems with the 900S.\n\nhttps://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/710S-Can-t-install-Linux-on-Ideapad-710S-how-do-you-disable-RAID/td-p/3432553 - The thread for the problem with the 710S.\n\nWill the Yoga Book and the Yoga 910 have these problems? We don't know because they are not released yet, but we should know soon.\n\nI've attached a screenshot of my review for the 900 ISK2 and Lenovo's reply.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/niewu\n\nSo they admitted that this is now a requirement for Signature PCs. \n\nSo be warned that if you buy a \"Microsoft Signature PC\", it may not be allowed to run Linux, per Microsoft.\n\nThe Yoga 900 ISK2 at Best Buy is not labeled as a Signature Edition PC, but apparently it is one, and Lenovo's agreement with Microsoft includes making sure Linux can't be installed.\n\n----\n\nUPDATE: I've sent emails out to several members of the media trying to shine some light on what Lenovo is up to. If anyone could help me ping some reporters I'd sure appreciate the help. So far I've contacted Adrian Kinglsey-Hughes, Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols, Michael Larabel of Phoronix, and Dr. Roy Schestowitz of Techrights. We've been discussing the issue on the Techrights IRC channel on Freenode, so Techrights might have something about this posted soon\n\n----\nI just commented for someone who is writing an article who asked me to speak. Here's part of what I said...\n\n\"I think that Lenovo's official reply is insufficient and carefully worded. They talk about how much they love to support Linux and then say that they don't support Linux on many of their own laptops. Actions speak louder than words, and there's no technical reason other than the BIOS RAID mode lock why the Yoga 900 ISK2 and other affected systems wouldn't be great Linux machines. I also think that locking down the thread and editing peoples comments and then blaming forum posters for being \"disruptive\" was uncalled for, and they're obviously trying to turn this around and make it seem like I am overreacting or somehow I'm at fault for what they did. And unfortunately, some of the media reports have taken up this narrative instead of looking into why Lenovo would do such things to their computers. There is no REAL issue with Linux not supporting these laptops other than the one Lenovo created. They need to make a BIOS patch that users can install, like other Ultrabook PC makers did, not more excuses.\"\n\n\"I think that [the BIOS RAID lock] was a deliberate design choice made by Lenovo, and I say that because the BIOS code that they use has AHCI mode available for the storage device, which Linux and Windows understand without any special drivers. Lenovo patched the code to remove the AHCI mode from the BIOS setup utility and then they wrote additional code to make sure that you can't set AHCI mode with an EFI variable using EFI shell. So, I'd say it's definitely deliberate, and can't see any LEGITIMATE reason why they would have. It isn't really faster, it makes recovering Windows from Microsoft's installer very difficult if you have to later. About the only thing putting a single SSD setup into RAID mode using the BIOS gives you is (a) Linux won't be able to use the storage and (b) greater potential for data loss.\"\n\n\"I think that Microsoft and Lenovo agreed to lock Linux out, and forcing RAID mode accomplishes that. In the last 11 months, nobody except one Lenovo forum poster that used a modded BIOS and an external flasher to get around Lenovo's signature check on BIOS updates has managed to install Linux on the Yoga models affected by this. I believe that Lenovo and Microsoft figured that if Linux ever did get driver support for this configuration, that it would be years after the product was released, so it might as well be forever. Most people replace their laptop every 5 years or less, so almost nobody would ever be able to run Linux on the Yoga laptops while in their designed service life.\"\n\nEdit: If anyone has anymore problems with Lenovo deleting the thread, here's the Wayback Machine version.\n\nPage 1 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921064057/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206\nPage 2 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921064404/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/2\nPage 3 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921064603/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/3\nPage 4 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921064734/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/4\nPage 5 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921064900/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/5\nPage 6 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921064949/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/6\nPage 7 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921065152/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/7\nPage 8 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921065333/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/8\nPage 9 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921065450/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/9\nPage 10 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921065541/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/10\nPage 11 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921065644/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/11\nPage 12 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921065754/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/12\nPage 13 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921070115/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/13\nPage 14 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921070321/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/14\nPage 15 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921070440/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/15\nPage 16 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921070608/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/16\nPage 17 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921070806/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/17\nPage 18 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921070912/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/18\nPage 19 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921071051/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/19",

    "body": "In AMD’s AMA [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/5x4hxu/we_are_amd_creators_of_athlon_radeon_and_other/), they say they will seriously consider releasing their Platform Security Processor (PSP) source code. This is their equivalent of the Intel Management Engine and would make AMD processors compatible with coreboot/libreboot.\n\nThis would be massive. It would make it possible to have a truly open-source machine, with all the security and privacy benefits that entails. At the moment secure boot relies primarily on aging Intel processors from nearly a decade ago.\n\nIn 2011, AMD began supporting coreboot, but stopped in 2013 and introduced the PSP. Why? Because they didn’t think it was economically worthwhile.\n\n**Don’t let that happen again!** Let’s tell AMD there is demand for this. Get into that thread and comment. And – more importantly – message them! If you’re reading this after the AMA has ended, contact them anyway!\n\n[AMD’s Twitter](https://twitter.com/amd?lang=en)\n\n[AMD’s Forums](https://community.amd.com/places?filterID=all~objecttype~space)\n\n[AMD’s contact page](https://www.amd.com/en-us/who-we-are/contact) (You can find details on AMD in your country) \n\nYou can also reach them on Facebook.\n\nEDIT: Some people are saying they want to call. I think that's great - do it! The best number I have found (so far) for North America is (877) 284-1566. Customer service, but they're able to take and pass on feedback at least. If anyone has other country numbers or a better one for North America, let me know and I can add them.\n\nEDIT 2: It’s working! This has ‘CEO level attention’.

Back in the [original AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/5x4hxu/we_are_amd_creators_of_athlon_radeon_and_other/), u/AMD_james (Product Manager in CPU Business Development) commented on this again in the last 2 hours. [Full comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/5x4hxu/we_are_amd_creators_of_athlon_radeon_and_other/dekwva9/?context=3): \n\n\n&gt;Thanks for the feedback. Please believe me that this has CEO level attention and AMD is investigating the steps and resources necessary to support this. It is not the work of a minute, so please bear with us as we define what we can do. \n\n\nJust to reiterate, this is **so important** for free, secure and open source computing. And enough people contacted AMD that they took notice. No actual change yet – but let’s keep letting them know how much we want it, and that it could be a major boost for AMD too.\n\n\nSo, in the next few days/weeks/months - **keep contacting AMD**! Don’t let them forget and don’t let the FOSS and security communities forget. This is a huge opportunity and one that might not come again.\n\n\nu/AMD_james is of course right that this will take a little time. So as we wait, don’t get mad that an open source PSP isn’t here yet. Instead, let’s just keep making it clear that we are grateful that they are looking into this and that if/when it does arrive, they will have a *lot* of dedicated customers and supporters.\n\n\nContact details below, again:\n\n\n[AMD’s Twitter](https://twitter.com/amd?lang=en)\n\n[AMD’s Forums](https://community.amd.com/places?filterID=all~objecttype~space)\n\n[AMD’s contact page](https://www.amd.com/en-us/who-we-are/contact) (You can find details on AMD in your country) \n\nBest number for North America: (877) 284-1566\n\nYou can also reach them on Facebook.\n\nEDIT: One other possibility – contact any media outlets you think might be interested. The more people this reaches, the better our chances.",

Here’s the breakdown:\n\n1. **Endless forms** with useless questions that took **10+ hours** to complete.\n2. **IQ-style test** (for some reason).\n3. **Language test**—seriously, why?\n\nAfter passing those, I moved to the interview stages:\n\n1. **Technical interview** – Python coding.\n2. **Manager interview** – Career discussions (with the hiring team).\n3. **Another tech interview** – System architecture and general tech questions.\n4. **HR interview** – Career-related topics, but HR had no clue about salary expectations.\n5. **Another manager interview** (not in the hiring team).\n6. **Hiring lead interview** – Positive feedback.\n7. **VP interview** – **Very positive feedback**, I was literally told, *\"You tick all the boxes for this position.\"*\n\nEventually, I **received an offer**. Since I was already employed, I resigned to start in four weeks. Even though the salary—revealed **only after four months**—was underwhelming, it was a bit higher than my previous job, so I accepted. The emotional toll of the long process made me push forward.\n\n# And then, the disaster…\n\nOne week after accepting the offer, I woke up to an email from the hiring manager stating that, after further discussions with upper management, they had decided to cancel my application.\n\nWhat upper management? No one ever mentioned this step. And why did this happen after I received an offer?\n\nI sent a few polite and respectful emails asking for an explanation. No response. Neither from my hiring manager nor HR.\n\nNow, I’m left starting from scratch (if not worse), struggling to pay my bills.\n\n# My advice if you’re considering Canonical:\n\n* Prepare emotionally for a very long process.\n* Expect childish behavior like this.\n* Never resign until you’ve actually started working.\n\nI would never recommend Canonical to anyone I care about. If you're considering applying, I highly recommend checking Reddit and Glassdoor for feedback on their hiring process to make your own judgment.\n\nP.S. :\n\n\\- If your company is recruiting in europe, and you can share that info or refer me. please do !",

Recently he got an expensive Lenovo and has dove headfirst into this Linux stuff. \n\nHe tries to explain it to me. I don’t know what he’s saying! “Ubuntu,” “Free and Open,” “terminal.” He’s got this new software that’s not google called “Brave.” He got a Raspeberry Pie thing for Christmas. He’s so enamored with it, and wants to share it with me and make me use it, but he can’t explain it to me well enough for me to understand and when looking it up myself I can’t find many basic user friendly explanations either. Frankly, I’m a little scared of computers. Terrified of getting hacked. Anything wonky looking on my computer scares me and sometimes Linux looks, well, creepy to me. It’s definitely my lack of knowledge. I am a complete noob. \n\nIf you guys had a friend, or gf, who knew nothing about Linux or ANYTHING, how would you even begin to explain it? I want to understand the slightest bit so I don’t crush his excitement with my lack of personal understanding (editing because the first way I worded it got the point across wrong)\n\nEdit:\n\nThank you guys! I can’t believe how this blew up. I have been reading through all of the comments and a majority of them have been kind and very helpful. :) There’s a stigma around nerds especially computer nerds sometimes and I was a little nervous to come on here but you guys really wowed me that you guys really just care about this stuff and want to help. I wanted to address some things I’ve gotten comments on:\n\nA lot of relationship advice. My boyfriend and I have talked about what the line is between sharing our stuff and being too melded together. He’s shown me many interests that I happen to have found I liked and vice versa. I’ve actually been pursuing some new interests recently such as cross stitch that can be my own thing apart from us. We very much enjoy each other and communicate often. Some of you are telling me not to feign interest and I’ll be honest, even if I don’t dive into this fully I just would like to know what he’s talking about to support him. \n\nEdited again because the passage I just wrote here didn’t make sense thank you guys again!!",

This guy's been through some serious shit.. some people may remember me running Windows 11 on it. Some might remember running Arch virtual machine without hardware acceleration inside of windows 11 and then running DOOM on it. But now as a Linux guy i decided that Arch is the was on this boy so I did it. Process is pretty straightforward and easy to anyone who has ever installed Arch and messed with Android phones internals. I got it working in a couple of hours. \nWhat works:\n        *Wifi/Bluetooth \n        *Touchscreen,120hz panel\n        *Audio\n        *GPU (Adreno 640) and CPU, obviously \n        *Dualboot with Android system \n        *USB for data transfer \nWhat does not:\n        *Charging (weird, may fix in the future)\n\nWell, I haven't done much with it yet bc I've just finished everything but I'm definitely going to make touchscreen work properly in Hyprland, maybe install some benchmarks and compare it with my surface laptop 4 haha. Anyway, if you have any questions I'm glad to answer them",

    "body": "*Brussels — April 1, 2025*\n\n\n\nIn a move that’s shaking up the tech world and raising eyebrows in Silicon Valley, the Belgian government has announced a groundbreaking new tariff: a **“Freedom Fee”** on all commercial software developed in the United States.\n\n\n\nEffective immediately, the new regulation introduces a 17.76% tax on American-made proprietary software sold or used in Belgium — a number officials insist is “purely symbolic” and definitely not a cheeky nod to US independence.\n\n\n\n“We believe in supporting software that reflects European values: openness, collaboration, and the joy of reading through thousands of lines of undocumented C code,” said Minister of Digital Affairs, Luc Verstegen, in a press conference held entirely via a LibreOffice Impress presentation. “This is not a punishment — it’s an encouragement to embrace open source. Also, Microsoft Excel crashed on us during the budget meetings.”\n\n\n\n**A Loophole for Libre**\n\n\n\nUnder the new policy, open-source software is fully exempt. Government agencies have reportedly already begun transitioning from Adobe products to GIMP and Inkscape, with mixed emotional results.\n\n\n\nPublic schools will phase out commercial learning software in favor of “whatever runs on Linux Mint,” and the Finance Ministry has proudly announced that all future taxes will now be calculated using LibreOffice Calc macros, described by one insider as “a heroic but deeply confusing experience.”\n\n\n\n**US Tech Giants Respond**\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for a major US software company, who asked not to be named (but their name rhymes with “Macrosoft”), warned that this could spark a digital trade war.\n\n\n\n“We support freedom — freedom to license, freedom to upsell, and freedom to crash during updates,” they said in a tersely worded Clippy-shaped press release.\n\n\n\n**FOSS Community Rejoices**\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, open-source developers worldwide are celebrating. GitHub has reported a spike in Belgian forks of previously dormant repos, including a sudden revival of interest in a 2003 Perl-based accounting tool named “MooseBudget.”\n\n\n\nLocal developer communities are planning a national holiday called “Libre Day,” during which Belgians will ceremonially uninstall commercial versions of antivirus software and replace them with open-source alternatives. Whether it’s a bold stand for digital sovereignty or just an elaborate April Fools’ prank with exceptional patch notes, one thing is clear: Belgium has officially ctrl-alt-deleted business as usual.\n\n\\#AprilFools #DigitalSovereignty #OpenSource #TechPolicy #GovTech #SoftwareTax #Innovation #MadeInBelgium #FOSS #DigitalTransformation #CyberHumor #LinkedInHumor #EUtech \n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaspernuyens\\_aprilfools-digitalsovereignty-opensource-activity-7312789588660355072-rohB/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=member\\_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAACO1wBefRMas4ftt\\_uS1IGBYyC\\_ziPY5k](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaspernuyens_aprilfools-digitalsovereignty-opensource-activity-7312789588660355072-rohB/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAACO1wBefRMas4ftt_uS1IGBYyC_ziPY5k)\n\n",

    "body": "Hey r/linux\n\nI wanted to share an exciting weekend project my kids and I tackled: we built a beast of a home server powered by an AMD EPYC 7C13 (3rd gen). This CPU is typically found in big cloud provider datacenters, but we managed to snag one on eBay for just $875 (MSRP is ~$7000)\n\n**Quick Benchmark Highlights:**\n\n- M.2 SSD: Achieves a blazing 7GB/sec throughput.\n- DDR4 RAM: Delivers a jaw-dropping 130GB/sec bandwidth.\n- Linux Kernel Build: Fully compiles with all options enabled in 10 minutes. (This would normally take an hour on a typical setup!)\n\nI actually did a separate post on this in r/homelab with more technical details/prices if you’re curious - https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1hmnnwg/built_a_powerful_and_silent_amd_epyc_home_server/\n\n**Part 2: We Created a Minimalist Linux Distro for It!**\n\nWe also developed and open-sourced a lightweight Linux distribution tailored for this server, called Sbnb Linux. You can check it out here: https://github.com/sbnb-io/sbnb\n\n**Why Sbnb Linux?**\n\nSbnb Linux is designed for simplicity, focusing on booting bare-metal servers and setting up remote connectivity with zero hassle using Tailscale. Even more remarkable, it comes pre-configured for Confidential Computing (AMD SEV-SNP) right out of the box. Learn more at README-CC.\n\n**How It Works:**\n\n- Write the sbnb.raw image to a USB flash drive.\n- Add your Tailscale key as plaintext to the drive.\n- Boot your server from the USB.\n- Within minutes, your server appears in your Tailscale machine list.\n- SSH to your server using Tailscale OAuth (e.g., Google Auth).\n- Bonus: With one Docker command, you can seamlessly switch Sbnb Linux to any other distro (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS, Alpine). See the https://github.com/sbnb-io/sbnb/ for details!\n\nThis combo of high-performance hardware and a minimalist OS has been incredibly satisfying to build.\n\nIf you’ve worked on something similar or have any questions about our setup, I’d be delighted to hear from you!\n\nI also extend a warm welcome to anyone interested in joining this exciting opportunity to develop a new Linux distro focused on confidential computing and resilience!",

We’re actually running on a Linux operating system. The software framework that we’re using is one that we developed at JPL for cubesats and instruments, and we [open-sourced](https://github.com/nasa/fprime) it a few years ago. So, you can get the software framework that’s flying on the Mars helicopter, and use it on your own project. It’s kind of an open-source victory, because we’re flying an open-source operating system and an open-source flight software framework and flying commercial parts that you can buy off the shelf if you wanted to do this yourself someday. This is a new thing for JPL because they tend to like what’s very safe and proven, but a lot of people are very excited about it, and we’re really looking forward to doing it.\n\nThe F' framework is on GitHub: https://github.com/nasa/fprime",

    "body": "In a recent update, the Raspberry Pi Foundation installed a Microsoft apt repository on all machines running Raspberry Pi OS (previously known as Raspbian) without the administrator’s knowledge.\n\nOfficially it’s because they endorse Microsoft’s IDE (!), but you’ll get it even if you installed from a light image and use your Pi headless without a GUI. This means that every time you do “apt update” on your Pi you are pinging a Microsoft server.\n\nThey also install Microsoft’s GPG key used to sign packages from that repository. This can potentially lead to a scenario where an update pulls a dependency from Microsoft’s repo and that package would be automatically trusted by the system.\n\nI switched all my Pi’s to vanilla Debian but there are other alternatives too. Check the /etc/apt/sources.list.d and /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d folders of your Pi’s and decide for yourself.\n\n**EDIT:** Some additional information. The vscode.list and microsoft.gpg files are created by a postinstall script for a package called raspberrypi-sys-mods, version 20210125, hosted on the Foundation's repository.\n\nDoing an \"apt show raspberrypi-sys-mods\" lists a GitHub repo as the package's homepage, but the changes weren't published until a few hours ago, almost two weeks after the package was built and hours after people were talking about this issue. Here a comment by a dev admitting the changes weren't pushed to GitHub until today: [https://github.com/RPi-Distro/raspberrypi-sys-mods/issues/41#issuecomment-773220437](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/raspberrypi-sys-mods/issues/41#issuecomment-773220437).\n\nPeople didn't have a chance to know about the new repo until it was already added to their sources, along with a Microsoft GPG key. Not very transparent to say the least. And in my opinion not how things should be done in the open source world. ",

This is because they have been burned by Windows sneaking in undesirable features, reinstalling applications (Edge) that they explicitly uninstalled, and even forcibly updating to Windows 11 from 10. They are justifiably looking to delete something that has, on the surface, harmed them in the past.\n\nBut they do not understand that auto-updates exist for a legitimate reason. Software bug fixes, QOL and Accessibility enhancements, and most critically, patching SECURITY vulnerabilities that must be done *immediately*!! Users should NOT be responsible for being proactive about this stuff, the vendors should! Auto-Updates are Good, Actually. I even allow my Arch to do it!\n\nI, of course, place the blame firmly at Microsoft. Their piggybacking on a security essential to push customer-unfriendly things all out of greed has directly contributed to a paranoia that directly hinders public safety.\n\nBut, open-source is here to repair the harm caused by corporate greed. **How can the Linux community as a whole contribute to lessening this paranoia and restore trust in those that actually work to keep their personal devices safe?**",

    "body": "i really like linux for its architecture, terminal tools and freedom to configure. but whenever i switch to my old 2017 macbook (dual core, 8gb ram) the ui just feels way smoother and more fun to look at. fonts look better, typing feels like a smooth water flow, mouse movement is buttery, animations look like they are perfectly timed. this is all on the same 4k monitor btw.\n\non linux (tried several distros, both xorg and wayland, different desktop envs) it works fine, but the visual part feels less polished. i know thats subjective, but since we stare at the screen 100% of the time, it kinda matters a lot.\n\nfrom what i read online it could be things like\n\n* core animation vs linux compositors\n* gpu rendering priority / frame timing\n* font rendering defaults (subpixel, hinting etc)\n* gtk vs qt differences\n\nso my questions are:\n\n1. is there a known technical reason why macos feels smoother out of the box?\n2. are there any linux setups that get close to this?\n3. is polish in the graphics stack just a lower priority for linux devs (and if yes, why?)\n\nnot trying to bash linux here, i actually want to use it as my main os. but so far i couldn’t get close to that same “smooth” feeling i get on macos, even though my linux hardware is much more powerful. any tips or explenations welcome.",

It's like everything simply works as expected, just a few clicks and you're set. When I first dipped my toes into programming, I became aware that other operating systems, like Linux, existed. But honestly, why would I choose Linux over Windows?\n\nThen something opened my eyes.\n\nI don't need to explicitly detail all the garbage surrounding Windows, especially how our data is treated by Microsoft. Sure, Windows might have almost every piece of software you need for work or leisure, but have you ever stopped to think about the true cost? Aren't we trading something far more valuable in exchange?\n\nEnough. I'm done with this.\n\nI want control over what I do and how I do it. That's why I'm switching to Linux. I know it's going to be tough at first... hell, I've already failed more times than I'd like to admit. But this time, I'm serious.\n\nSo here's my question: what advice can you give me?

    "body": "This is coming back from someone that used Linux for about a year and half as a daily distro and recently switched back to Windows. Don't get me wrong, if I ever get a laptop that isn't a gaming one or build a full AMD PC, I will use Linux, as the possibilities with it are endless and it's kind of fun, but for a lot of people - please, do the research, not only about software, but also hardware.\n\nI'm not going to get into the all the issues I've had, just my personal experience and advice for people looking to switch\n\n* If you use custom game launchers, mod managers or any other custom stuff, try to look for information if it's possible to run it on Linux. Most of the time, they will work, but the chances are, they won't be as easy to set up. \n* If you use some peripherals that rely on some software, look into if there are options to manage it on Linux. But still, keep in mind, that if you use some niche thing, there's a chance you won't be able to properly use it on Linux. And even with some popular brands, there still might be issue. For example, my Logitech G920 steering wheel. It is possible to use it, but the drivers have some weird issues that it's not worth the time to try and fix it compared to the time I actually use the wheel.\n   * Mice - Piper\n   * RGB - OpenRGB, SignalRGB\n   * Steering wheels - Oversteer\n   * And a bunch of others...\n* Here, I might offend some people. Microsoft Office has no competitors. While yes, LibreOffice, OpenOffice and others do exist, Microsoft Office is just, sadly, better. Yes, Office for Web does exist, but it's meh also. But, don't be afraid, there are options to run it on Linux - WinApps, some Windows docker tool (forgot how it's called), virtual machines and I'm guessing in time, there will be other options also.\n* A lot of alternative software also works on Windows. So if you wanna test, for example, the before mentioned LibreOffice, or DaVinci Resolve or GIMP or any other stuff, you can do so on Windows and decide if that software will actually fit your needs. \n* And the last thing and I think it's the most important one, Linux isn't not as easy as most people like to say. If you use it solely as a Steam gaming machine, get some distro like Bazzite and maybe you'll be alright, or just as a video/documents machine you're fine, but if you use it for much more, I'm 90% sure, you will run into some weird issue at some point, that you wouldn't have on Windows and you will need to run a terminal or look through config files to resolve it. The only thing I would suggest, don't rely on AI to try and resolve issues like this. Most of the time it has outdated information or something that actually is not right for your choice of distribution. Linux communities are great, so just ask around and you'll definitely find a solution.\n\n  \nAnd for the end of this, Windows still stucks, ran into the issues the minute I booted into it :) But at the same time, it runs everything I need without a hassle.

After spending time reading posts here and elsewhere, I’m convinced there are real benefits e.g. stability, privacy, control, and a strong community. I’m sold on the *IDEA* of Linux. But in practice, I keep hitting walls (even if they are small walls).\n\nI’ve tried a number of distros recently such as Linux Mint, Zorin OS, Pop!\\_OS, Nobara, Ultramarine, and most recently openSUSE (really loved this one). But every time, there’s always something that doesn’t work out of the box: a printer, an external monitor, Bluetooth, weird suspend issues, etc. The kinds of things that should “just work.”\n\nI don’t mind using the terminal when I need to because I was a sysadmin for years (but haven't used Linux in like 15 years and memory hasn't been on my side) but I simply don’t have the time to spend hours troubleshooting basic stuff anymore. And that’s what makes it hard to commit. Each time I run into one of these snags, I end up back on Windows, feeling frustrated and disappointed.\n\nHow do you manage the trade-off between control and convenience?\n\nIs it realistic to expect a “just works” experience on Linux if I don’t want to tinker much?\n\nI’m not trying to start a distro war or complain for the sake of it. I want to make this work. Just hoping to hear from people who’ve either overcome these same frustrations.

    "body": "Why is ext4 recommended over xfs? It seems like after doing a bit of research, xfs is \"better\" in just about every way--more performant in edge cases, arguably just as \"stable\", continues to be highly developed (and from some reading, some claim its codebase is more more developer-friendly and manageable). It is even the default filesystem for some distros. It seems preferred in enterprise solutions, which should suggest it's reliable/performant. In most if not all aspects, it is at least equal if not better.\n\nBut I remember starting Linux and ext4 was the overwhelming recommendation as the best general-purpose filesystem (and I'm considering xfs as general-purpose hence the comparison), so much so that I didn't think xfs was as serious of an alternative.\n\nI believe one real complaint was that xfs was not as resilient when it fails as a result of power/disk failure, but I've come across comments that suggest this has been fixed over time and it is no less prone to such failures compared to filesystems like ext4. It is also more CPU-intensive but I'm not sure if this is actually relevant even in use cases like on a Pi server.\n\nI'm thinking of using xfs for all use cases: external drives, whether HDD or flash storage and for thumb drives and SD cards; for NAS; for backup storage, etc.) unless I need snapshotting capabilities such as for system partitions in which case I would use btrfs which is more featureful at the expense of overhead.\n\nIn doing some research I think exFAT is also of interest as a filesystem for certain applications (definitely not general purpose for Linux use) as a lean filesystem but it seems to be just slightly too barebones (case-insensitivity and relatively shorter filenames so not suitable for backing up files, permission are sometimes useful but exFAT is permission-less). I think exFAT might be ideal for backup drives with software like borg/kopia which does encryption themselves so these don't matter(?).\n\nIs this a decent comparison of the filesystems and what have I overlooked? I'm sure for desktop users perhaps none of these benefits may be felt but _choosing_ a filesystem costs nothing and in that case isn't it better to choose something that appears to be more/better developed and with the assurance of being used in an enterprise setting with no apparent downsides?",

    "body": "I am new to Linux but I am really enjoying learning all there is about Linux's past, and I have noticed a fair share of interesting projects that I am disappointed are now abandoned. Here is one from me:\n\n--\n\n---\n\n[**Project Looking Glass**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Looking_Glass) \n\n&gt;  Looking Glass was first developed by **Hideya Kawahara**, a Sun programmer who wrote it in his spare time on a Linux laptop. After demonstrating an early version to Sun executives, he was assigned to it full-time with a dedicated team and open sourced the project.\n\n*- Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia*\n\n--\n \n\nProject Looking Glass was a WM licensed under the GPL(2.0) that was written in the Java language primarily made for Linux that also aimed to be crossplatform to other *NIX systems and even Windows! It started as a hobby project but was for a time officially supported by Sun Microsystems. Unless I am missing some hobby project there isn't one written in Java that exists anymore, so Java alone would make it interesting but that's just the surface of it.\n\n Unlike all major environments today it was not just 2D with 3D effects, it was FULLY 3D. It used **Java3D** with graphical acceleration to build 3d windows for both existing application programs and ones specifically designed for Looking Glass. So the really interesting part of this WM was the unique ways it leveraged it's 3D nature to adopt completely revolutionary features and solutions to problems for the time and honestly, still to this day.\n\n For example, windows were drawn in 3D, and you could turn them around and draw faces at the back of them, that meant that you could theoretically have two different windows on one single window. And the sides of windows had the names of it's title displayed like books! Seriously, [take a look at how cool it was.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Looking_Glass#/media/File:LG3D-slanted-windows.jpg) - The project has long since been abandoned. It was probably one of the many casualties of the butchering of Sun Microsystems after the 2008 Financial Crisis and it's buyout by [the Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation), it's last update was in 2007. Java 3D isn't officially maintained anymore either, while a fan maintained project exists it's apparently slow moving with updates. However if one of you renegades out there want to take a look at it for inspiration, [the read-only source tree](https://github.com/Ed-Fernando) of the [core](https://github.com/Ed-Fernando/lg3d-core) and other applications that came with it have been mirrored on Github (thanks Ed Fernando!)\n\n--\n\n\nSad fact: After a fun demonstration of it at the 2003 Linux Expo, Apple CEO Steve Jobs personally called up the [CEO of Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_I._Schwartz) and told him point blank that Apple **would sue Sun if they moved forward to commercialize it.** Jobs felt the project infringed Apple's intellectual property. Apparently this decision was not the reason it was dropped, since it received support for years after but I am sure it didn't help. -  Oh, and just to twist the knife Apple would also later do something *suspiciously similar* to Project Looking Glass with their widgets &amp; their dock on Leopard.  😕\n\n\n---\n\n--\n\nSorry for the longish write up, but researching this is what made me interested in more projects like this from Linux's past that haven't been documented for us later Linux users to discover. - What are some unique projects that ***you***  miss from the past? Sentimental or stuff that would still be revolutionary. Both are fine!  \n\nPrevious versions that are starkly different from currently maintained projects too, I suppose!",

A few days ago, some friends who cannot upgrade to Windows 11 asked me to install a system like mine. They had to use Gnome, specifically 13 Trixie, and the thing is that when I started showing them how everything worked and making them see that, except on rare occasions, you don't have to touch the terminal and you can do everything like in Windows, with mouse clicks and they liked what I showed them, the question came: security? Since they are only going to use it for home, browsing, YouTube and some online shopping, I only enable the firewall, which is how I have it, now, should I install or implement something else? When they asked me about an antivirus I almost laughed, but how do I know they will be safe when browsing the Internet?",

    "title": "Why the hate on beginner-friendly distros?",
    "body": "I've seen a lot of hate towards beginner-friendly distros around the internet. I'm a somewhat newcomer to Linux and I use ZorinOS currently, primarily because it's ready OOTB and it meets my requirements for daily activities (studying, coding, offline gaming). (context: I have 8GB of RAM on my laptop and Spyware 11 took 7GB  just to \"exist\").\n\n  \nI understand that beginner distros are very restraining on the potential of Linux, but I think it is a good thing for the most part. Let me explain:\n\nFrom what i see, beginner-friendly distros are a good way to free everyday users from Spyware 11 and Fuckintosh and expand the lifespan of older PCs. Keeping in mind that apart from Adobe, Solidworks and other industry-required software (that are mostly used by people who have to work with this stuff), and that the majority of PC users only needs a browser, ad doc editor and a spreadsheet for the everyday usage,  wouldn't be useful to have ready to use distros with recognizable interfaces?\n\nAnother thing to consider: these distros can be helpful to make the transition easier for non-tech-savvy people and older generations who are not always willing to learn a new interface from scratch.\n\nWhat's your opinion on the matter? Should we just realize the fact that non everybody wants to spend hours just to set up wifi drivers? Or instead the larger public should start to get into the detail on how linux works?\n\n\nEDIT: ok looking back at the comments I realize a may have previously stumbled in some “hardcore” Linux power users or something like that. I now see that in the broader community there is no real “hate” on beginner friendly distros and instead most people actually recommend these kind of distros to newcomers. (Prolly my viewpoint was also bc I’m graduating in computer engineering, there are a lot of edgelords in my class)\nThanks guys, you’ve shown me the real part of the community, you made me want to come more around here, gg everyone &lt;3",

Don't get me wrong Gnome is good but for me it feels off for some reason.\n\nAfter my adventure with Ubuntu, I used Zorin as I heard it felt more like Windows and it is easy to get in and it was right I learned most my linux stuff in Zorin but I started to feel like Zorin wasn't either as I asked for something light-weight too.\n\nAfter Zorin, Bazzite with KDE came and oh boy...Bazzite might be the longest I stick to a distro for a good while. I used it like a month before saying \"ugh\" due to gtk mouse error keep popping in terminal when something needs to be written and even in latest update when I tried it had the same issue, after that I went back to Windows just to remember why I don't like Windows 11, it uses so much resource and it is not even good to use nor easy to customize so I went on my search for new distro and I met, Fedora.\n\nSo far I think positively about Fedora 42 (KDE Plasma Edition). it is faster, it allows my resources used better and it allows me to do my day to day work fast and efficiently with no error or issues and even then when it has issues it is mostly on me bc I keep looking around and doing things I shouldn't even tho my child like brain tells me to poke things I see. Other than that I like how KDE is, it has it's issues but overall I feel more in home with how customizable it is.\n\nFor now I don't plan to distro hop but if I do, I would change to get Arch with KDE but first I need to learn how to setup Arch.\n\nIf I like a suggestion I will try and yeah see how it is\n\nEDIT: I accidentally nuked my Fedora install when I was installing arch bc I had no space and wanted go make a partition by splitting the fedora's space XD",

On the one hand, it's got better \"security\" whatever that means, but on another hand, it fragments the Linux ecosystem (even more than it is) and is missing features that X has had since a long time ago. One would think that a worthy replacement does not break things, only fixes them. Is there anything weighty to add to the Wayland hand that I'm missing?",

The System clearly causes a lot of issues, hence why we have Flatpack on the Desktop and Docker or LXC on the server to deal with the dependency hell that's destant to unfold because of this design (I know Flatpack and Docker have other features as well, but solving dependency hell  between libraries is still one of the main selling points).\n\nI'm also aware that historically there were many good reasons for going with dynamically linked applications - mostly storage and memory savings, but I'd say these days they don't really apply.

Sometimes you only get binaries and have to build everything yourself.  \nUbuntu, on the other hand, is easy to install, most software works immediately, and you generally do not run into many issues, although you get less customization in some areas.\n\nI work with languages like C# and C++, and in my experience Linux is great for development. The problem is that I also play a lot of games, including VR.  \nOn Fedora, I liked how customizable the interface was and how easy it was to set up my development environment, but I had problems with my VR setup and some games.

    "body": "EDIT:\n\nThanks everyone for the input! Been very helpful all over - I'll be looking into a number of distros and tools you've recommended. Big takeaway for me is that Linux software is all in singular repos, which may seem obvious to you but as a lifelong Windows user retrieving software from hundreds of random sites, I thought of the Software Manager as a 'basic suite' option rather than the main place I'm meant to install from.\n\nThanks all :)\n\n  \n\\---------------\n\n\n\nSimplest way to describe my perspective is as follows:\n\nI love the concept of open source software - I have great respect for people who develop these systems and those that can make use of them to the fullest extent.\n\nHowever, I am not a power user of any kind. I have been trying out Linux Mint on a secondary laptop for about a year now to see if I can ultimately switch from Windows. The basic functionality is completely fine and the 'out of the box' software does it's job, but in order to set up normal installs for software I am forced to use terminal far more than I would like.\n\nThe software manager is unreliable as it often points to old unmaintained forks and adds their inactive repositories, so I've tried to install most things through terminal/github but this is not what I want out of my operating system. I want to use my computer as a tool and I don't have any interest in learning extensive terminal language just to do so - and it's uncomfortable to use this system when every install guide asks you to use 'sudo' followed by a string I have zero understanding of the function of.\n\nAs an example: today I tried to setup OneDrive (https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive/) and realised that this does not have any GUI. No worries, in the extensive usage notes the dev links to a supported GUI (https://github.com/bpozdena/OneDriveGUI). To set this up I need to clone the github directory. To clone the directory I need a developer PAT (and I don't properly understand how this works). OK, now it's cloned I need to install PySide6 Essentials which seems to be on the official python package index but for some reason will not allow me to install unless it's done inside a virtual environment (which again I do not understand properly). So I install the python3.12-venv, activate the venv and try to run the file and the error I get is \"Could not load the Qt platform plugin \"xcb\" in \"\" even though it was found\". Searching for this i run into this StackOverflow question that looks just exhausting to go through (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59809703/could-not-load-the-qt-platform-plugin-xcb-in-even-though-it-was-found)\n\nTLDR - I find the constant need to troubleshoot and use command line exhausting, I have no bandwidth to learn linux in any meaningful depth, I chose Mint because it was recommended as one of the simplest. Is there a better option? Are automated installers? Should I give up and just use Windows forever? Given that I don't view using my operating system as a hobby, is linux an impractical for basic users?\n\nThanks for reading, I'm impressed by you all who know your way around these systems so well, keen to hear your thoughts.",

She works on these presentations for her job, so reliable compatibility is a must.\n\nI’ve heard WPS Office is often recommended for smoother PPT handling on Linux, but I’m also aware of OnlyOffice. Has anyone used either for complex animations and embedded videos? If so, did everything transfer over okay when sharing files with Windows users?\n\nOn a side note, I noticed ToolSmart.ai has a small YouTube-to-MP3 feature that might help if she needs audio snippets in her presentations, plus a free paraphrasing tool that could be useful for speaker notes. Curious if anyone’s tried these. I just want to be sure the transition to a Linux-based workflow goes as smoothly as possible.\n\n",

GDB is powerful but the GUI wrappers around it lack very much(which from my limited experience I have to agree hence why I opt for the command line version anyway)\n2.

I would bend and use another free cloud backup drive if it is free and runs correctly on Linux and on Windows.\n* Works with the three monitors on my desk that run in Windows and while going through the Debian boot messages off the laptop and docking station. Debian didn't. I could only bring up two. Any two of the three come up fine, but only two.\n\nWhat advice do people have?\n\nEdit: I am very pleased by all responses save one.

This is because they have been burned by Windows sneaking in undesirable features, reinstalling applications (Edge) that they explicitly uninstalled, and even forcibly updating to Windows 11 from 10. They are justifiably looking to delete something that has, on the surface, harmed them in the past.\n\nBut they do not understand that auto-updates exist for a legitimate reason. Software bug fixes, QOL and Accessibility enhancements, and most critically, patching SECURITY vulnerabilities that must be done *immediately*!! Users should NOT be responsible for being proactive about this stuff, the vendors should! Auto-Updates are Good, Actually. I even allow my Arch to do it!\n\nI, of course, place the blame firmly at Microsoft. Their piggybacking on a security essential to push customer-unfriendly things all out of greed has directly contributed to a paranoia that directly hinders public safety.\n\nBut, open-source is here to repair the harm caused by corporate greed. **How can the Linux community as a whole contribute to lessening this paranoia and restore trust in those that actually work to keep their personal devices safe?**",

    "body": "**EDIT:** Original post kept down below to keep consistency with the comments, but I wanted to take a moment to address the legitimate criticism my snarky, off-the-cuff post has received by making a more serious version of this post that is actually helpful.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you are reading this post, you are either...\n\n * ... new to Linux and have chosen Kali as your first distribution, if so, **this post is for you.**\n * ... not new to Linux and take issue with the title, if so, **this post is not for you, but you will comment anyway.**\n * ... studying cyber security and are wondering why you shouldn't install it, **this post is not intended for you.**\n\nFirst, welcome to Linux, you're in for an exciting ride! Learning to use Linux is like experiencing computers for the first time again, a lot of your knowledge about Windows can be thrown out the window and you get to rediscover what makes computing fun again. Unfortunately, getting started with Linux can be overwhelming for newcomers, with a lot of choices to select from but a lack of knowledge to make the right choice for yourself.\n\nLately there's been an influx of people who are installing Kali as their daily driver, main Linux distribution to use for desktop usage; asking questions that are a direct result of misunderstanding what Kali is for and ignoring the strong advice of the distribution to not use it that way. Such questions are a waste of everyone time's including your own, but more importantly, may discourage you from trying to use Linux again by assuming that that is the normal experience.\n\n**Why shouldn't I install Kali?**\n\nDo not just take my word for it, read the documentation: https://docs.kali.org/introduction/should-i-use-kali-linux\n\nBut in short: Kali Linux is a hyper specialized distribution meant for security experts, penetration testers and the likes. It is not meant to be used as a general purpose operating system. The ideal way to use Kali Linux is from an USB stick or, even better, a virtual machine. Kali is more like a tool suite than an operating system.\n\n**I want a secure distro and Kali is a security distro!**\n\nKali Linux is not a secure distribution of Linux in the defensive sense, it is an *offensive* security distribution. The tools that it comes with are specifically meant to attack networks. The tools Kali Linux comes with are dangerous, and if used improperly can even lead *to serious legal consequences.*\n\nIf you want a secure defensive Linux distribution, you have many alternatives such as *Parrot Home Edition* as an example.\n\n**I watched Mr Robot and I want to become a cool hackerman and you're wrong so I'm going to do it anyway.**\n\nGo ahead, no one is stopping you from throwing caution to the wind. The best case scenario is that you'll get bored of it within a few hours, the worst case scenario is that you think this is what Linux is about. It's not, Linux is normally very convenient and easy to work with, read on to learn more.\n\nFurthermore, do not expect to get any help. The people in r/kalilinux will mock you for ignoring the documentation; and people here will most likely tell you to install something else.\n\n**Okay, I tried it and my infosec dreams are shattered, I hacked my local coffeeshop's wifi and got arrested, and I cannot use computers anymore.**\n\nI warned you!!\n\n**What Linux distribution should I actually install if I am new to Linux?**\n\nGenerally speaking, Ubuntu is highly recommended to newcomers as this is the most supported distribution by most third party software developers like Valve, Discord and many others. It is very popular and you will have the most luck finding solutions to issues you are likely to run into as many people will have had the same problems you did.\n\nThat said, Linux distributions come in many shapes, sizes, flavors and colors and you are encouraged to experiment and try for yourself. Some other distributions that are suitable for beginners (though some are easier than others) are:\n\n- Linux Mint\n- Pop_OS!\n- Manjaro Linux\n- OpenSuSE\n- Fedora Linux\n- Debian\n\nGood luck in your Linux journey!\n\nOld post\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRepeat after me:\n\n * Kali Linux is for pentesters, you are not to install it, the documentation for Kali tells you this.\n * If you think you'd like to use Kali as a desktop OS, you aren't ready to use an OS like Kali in any capacity.\n * No, you're not cool for installing Kali, it doesn't make you a hacker, just install Ubuntu.\n\nFeel free to `sed s/Kali/Parrot/` too, and any other pentesting, security oriented OS.",

    "body": "#What's going on?\n\nA recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app **permanently inaccessible** to users.\n\nOn May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/) to [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/) to [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/).\n\nEven if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface [](/ajwtf \"and everything that goes with it!\").\n\nThis isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.\n\n#What's the plan? \n\nOn June 12th, [many subreddits](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away *permanently* unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because *we love Reddit*, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.\n\nThe two-day blackout isn't the *goal*, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.\n\nWhat can *you* do?\n\n1. **Complain.** Message the mods of /r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit: submit a [support request](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new): comment in relevant threads on /r/reddit, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/.), leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.\n\n2. **Spread the word.** Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at /r/ModCoord  - but please don't pester mods you *don't* know by simply spamming their modmail.\n\n3. **Boycott *and* spread the word...to Reddit's competition!** Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite *non*-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!\n\n4. **Don't be a jerk.** As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible. **This includes not harassing moderators of subreddits who have chosen not to take part**: no one likes a missionary, a used-car salesman, or a flame warrior.",

    "body": "Salutations, I hope everyone is well here. \n\nSo, I have made it a personal goal of mine to update and upgrade Hannah Montana Linux, the old Linux OS back from 2009. When I do a Uname -a, it appears the OS is Linux Ubuntu 2.6.28-13 generic.  \n\nSo, I *almost* got there successfully, by replacing some instances in the sources.list file with old-releases.Ubuntu.com.  \n\nThough, after attempting to distribution upgrade, after a while, the terminal states that Max Reports is reached and that there is no space left on the device. What I don’t understand is that I gave this live VM 50GB, so I thought it would be enough. Would I need more? What would I need to do to effectively upgrade this monstrosity? \n\n\nEDIT: I fixed the storage issue, but now there is an issue with releasing the upgrade. See this image \n[Terminal Output](https://i.stack.imgur.com/FyF53.png) . \n\nEDIT 2: Thank you everyone for your comments, suggestions, and ideas! Yes, I am serious about trying to modernize Hannah Montana Linux. I want today’s individuals to feel an active and updated HML. It’s a personal project of mine. It was either that, or, with great regret, to begin production of an iCarly Linux. \n\nThanks for the silver award!",

Martin helmke, Linux Bible, cur rently reading  Linux Command Line, autobiography by Torvalds etc. He knows a lot of the  terminology - he says stuff related to KDE, GNOME, distro, etc. which I  dont understand. I am assuming that is fairly simple stuff but I cannot  tell how deep his knowledge goes.\n\nI  looked up these forums and realized that he should not just read but  also actively do. So sometimes we sit together and tinker around with  the command line on his Raspberry Pi.\n\nWhat  else should he be doing? He is in it purely out of interest. So can you  recommend any new activities, any other books? If he continues, what  should he do next? With coding, usually you make an app or create  websites etc when you are older. What do you do with knowledge in Linux?\n\nEdit: Thanks to everyone for your comments and suggestions. I will look into each and everyone of them.",

    "title": "I have just been told that I can't use Linux on my personal computer for school.",
    "body": "3 years ago, I \"hacked\" the school (I actually just changed permissions on my user folder that the school gave me, so no one could access it). I was told not to do it again and that was pretty much the end of it. I have been using Linux as my main operating system for just over 2 years. In these 2 years there have been no problems with me doing this and many teachers knew that I was using it.\n\nJust this week however, I was accused of \"hacking\" again, when actually it was another kid who was just ddosing the network so he had an excuse not to do work. Before they found him however, I was investigated because of what I did 3 years ago and was told that if I did not hand over my laptop and usbs, they would call in the police. Now, since the time I \"hacked\" the school, I have been very interested in how people do actual hacks and have tried multiple scripts on personal computers, BUT NEVER ON THE SCHOOL NETWORK. One of the usbs they checked had ncat for windows on it and a rootkit script on it. They have since then told me that I am not able to use my personal computer unless I use windows and reformat the Linux partition or use one the school loaned Pentium computers.\n\nThis is the most stupid thing I have ever heard, but they will hear none of the legitimate reasons people actually use Linux. I am wondering if there are any laws or rights that I can bring up in order to keep using Linux or if there are any methods of disguising Linux as windows in order to keep using it? I live in Australia if that helps with finding laws. Anything would be very much appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks Heaps for all the ideas, I really appreciate it, and I'll be sure to update you guys on what happens.\n\nEdit 2: There seems to be a bit of confusion on who owns the computer that I do school work on. The laptop is mine, and they are currently wanting me to use one of there school laptops that has windows installed on it because that means I’m not allowed to install anything on it, it should be free if I did choose to however (I’m not going to though). I am definitely considering just asking to be disconnected from the network instead of changing operating systems since I can just use mobile data.\n\nEdit 3: A bit late, but better than never. The result of this ended up being me given a school laptop instead of allowing me to use mine while at school. Their logic in this was that if another incident were to happen with their system, I would not be less suspicious as I am using a locked down system. This is pretty annoying, but definatly not the worst thing to happen in the world and I am super fortunate that they didn't just suspend me for having crap on my USB.  ",

    "body": "Following my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/voidlinux/comments/eqm4k6/systemd_seems_to_be_showing_up_in_tmp/) on r/voidlinux (no `systemd`), where I noticed `systemd` binaries showing up in `htop` and draining resources, after some help it turned out it's a trojan disguised as a `systemd` binary, according to [virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/bd137e0c7e1fd790993cc7204145cbeff073d0c0d1f6d13e99356d560c49410b/detection).    \n\nAnyway, I located the binary, and it seems to be using `cgmanager` to run itself. How fucked I am?\n\n[Here is the output of](https://imgur.com/a/cwRKf1m) `ps aux | grep systemd`.   \nI tried to kill it, yet it keeps respawning. And it seems to hook itself with `cgmanager`. How can I disable that?     \n\n\n\n**EDIT 1:** [I also noticed whenever I enter the graphical shell (`startx`), the trojan `systemd` binary starts itself in /tmp](https://i.imgur.com/1eqz2ky.png). How can I locate the source that execute the file?\n\n\n\n\n**EDIT 2:** I removed `cgmanager` although I think it doesn't have to do with `systemd` here.  \nAnyway I figured out how the malware works. First it tries to run itself from /tmp/, if it doesn't run, it runs itself either from /.local/share or from /.config/.   \nI added `noexec` to /tmp, that actually stopped a couple of malware names from running (basically the names that the malware use to disguise itself are: `gvfs`, `initctl`, `ibus-x11`, `dbus-daemon`, `systemd`, and others.   \n\nI installed socklog, how can I use it (or any other logging software) to trace the automatic execution    \n\n\n**EDIT 3:** **I found the source**   \n2 files (`~/.ssh/config/service/ssh-agent`, and `~/.local/share/icc/icc-daemon`). Somehow my `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile` were modified to let these files to start up (noticed that when changing users the program didn't start). [Here is a screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/voi8aC3).\n\nAnyway, I still have the binaries of the files, just to inspect them later, if anyone wants to take a look let me know. So far, I think I solved it. But my ssh keys are fucked I guess.\n\n\n**FINAL UPDATE** Thanks to u/AN3223 for pointing it out, the source seems to come from an **addon for Kodi**, according to [discussions on linux forums](https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-mint-84/recent-update-causes-high-cpu-usage-4175636164/page2.html), [majaro's forums](https://forum.manjaro.org/t/weird-folder-in-tmp-on-boot-kodi-plugins-related/56603/15), [pclinuxos](https://www.pclinuxos.com/forum/index.php/topic,146020.0.html) and a [blog post on how to get rid of it](http://www.lieberbiber.de/2018/09/04/a-look-a-the-linux-coinminer-bc-malware/), and some users on reddit also ran into this exact malware [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace/comments/7wruj9/psa_i_found_a_virustrojanminer_in_kodi_arch_linux/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Addons4Kodi/comments/9fjc1g/cryptominer_in_gaia/).   \n[u/funfollower](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/ernlku/i_found_out_i_have_a_trojan_on_my_machine/ff5rcir/) pointed that [the vulnerability has been investigated 5 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace/comments/8dx7nj/psa_please_check_if/).",

I have a google account with 2FA.\n\nSuddenly the browser windows started opening up and windows/tabs moving (I saw from the other side of the room) “your computer's going crazy” says my wife.\n\nI quickly turned off wifi via hard switch, shut browser and notice a big yellow sticky note (applet) open on my kde desktop with following notes (which I did not write!):\n\n“*Schindler's List”, standing on his balcony p...*\n\n*Extreme*\n\n*12:37*\n\n*The Extraordinary Voyage of the Polish Submarine Orzel*\n\nThe first two lines appear to be a youtube video copy-paste from the notes “Schindlers...”, Extreme being the channel name (rather distasteful!).\n\nThe second two lines seem to be the duration (12:37) and title of another youtube video “The Extraordinary...”\n\nForensics:\n\nIn Firefox, I can see the history:\n\n20:11 he opened my reddit inbox (in a FF container) – nothing has changed on this page.\n\n20:11 he opened a bookmarked Google Doc – this opens in a new FF Container with me logged in.\n\n20:12 he opened Google login page – probably autofilled my username via lastpass\n\n20:12 he opened Google password page – probably autofilled via lastpass\n\n20:14 he clicked on a video link in an already open tab – loud dialogue started causing me to think “what the hell...someone's in my computer!!”\n\n20:14 run over to laptop, see incognito window closing, and see two NoScript popups open (#tab13 and #tab 17) with message about cross site scripting.\n\nHow did he get in?\n\nWhat could he have done?\n\nI can't see anything unusual in journald or system logs – any others to check? Can I see if he accessed my files?\n\nI immediately changed my lastpass password and Google password on another PC.\n\nThanks for any suggestions on why or how. I'll reformat this laptop!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT 1: I had just added the Smart Referer addon about 20 mins previously, if this has any relevance.\n\nEDIT 2: Reading a bit, maybe it was a XSS attack. I was on the Invidious website (youtube proxy site) and that is where the copy-pastes on my clipboard and on the sticky note seem to have come from.\n\nEDIT 3: On my clipboard is text from the open [invidio.us](https://invidio.us) page - seems pretty unfocused copy-pasting. This seems related to the material on the yellow sticky note, but is not the same.\n\nEDIT4: **Wow**, I realise from the number of posts that the potential implications are massive, but you have suggested several things that may point to a more **mundane** explanation:\n\n* No ssh or remote control software installed, therefore this would require a highly unlikely breaking out of the sandboxed Firefox. It is pretty much a fresh install with just my files and Tbird/Firefox configured.\n* My addons should block all 3rd party scripts (notably NoScript and Ublock Origin, but others also). I've checked and there are no scripts running on the page I had open ([invideo.us](https://invideo.us)) according to NoScript\n* I'm pretty sure that the iso is legit since it is downloaded from the official torrent with multiple seeders - I'll check the sha56sum tonight. I'll also check the proton cli downloaded from the proton vpn site.\n* Significantly all the actions are focused in the top right hand of the screen (incognito, open/close windows, bookmarked google doc in toolbar, google login, reddit inbox). \n* Kde shortcut exists on trackpad allowing copy-pasting to notes (and clipboard) via the trackpad\n* Seemingly random nature of material copy-pasted.\n* Laptop sitting on woollen cushion with my metal spectacles placed close to trackpad (static?). \n* No anomalies in the log files I've looked at so far\n* I'm a pretty boring person and unlikely to be the target of nation states or sophisticated hackers\n\nI am starting to think (hope) that trackpad was buggy, perhaps related to spectacles and static, and that the cursor somehow drifted to the upper right of the screen and started hammering on links and functions in that area, by chance doing something rather surprising (e.g. creating sticky note and pasting into it!).\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

    "title": "Sad state of hardware accelerated video on linux browser",
    "body": "At present, a user has only two options for a reasonable browser as firefox and chromium. All other browsers are either derivatives of above, or simply unsuitable for modern use (couple of webkit based mayb be usable but I have little idea how to enable hardware acceleration on them). So i will detail the steps required to enable browser hardware accelerated video on both and how there are compromises in either. My graphics card is amd 260x with open source amdgpu driver. CPU is i7 2600k.\n\nBefore starting, let me answer why a user would prefer to enable hardware acceleration in first place:\n\n1. Improve battery life in portable devices\n2. Save CPU resources for other tasks\n3. Prevent excess fan noise / cpu heating\n\n# Firefox\n\nFirefox currently supports hardware acceleration on both x11 and wayland. I tested on firefox 96 (nightly) to give best shot possible. So the following settings need to be changed in `about:config`:\n\n    media.ffmpeg.vaapi.enabled\ttrue\n    gfx.webrender.all\t        true\n    media.ffvpx.enabled             false\n\nIn addition, while running X11, firefox should be launched with variable `MOZ_X11_EGL=1` . Also, users should ensure that vaapi is available by installing/running `vainfo` in terminal. In cases where gpu only supports h.264 decode, its beneficial to install [h.264ify](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/h264ify/).\n\nWhat works:\n\n1. both 30fps/60fps or higher videos play smoothly at resolutions supported by gpu decoder.\n2. CPU usage is significantly reduced while playing videos\n\nThe problems:\n\n1. The colour of videos appears washed out. (0,0,0) is mapped to (16,16,16) and (255,255,255) to (235,235,235). [Bug 1726186](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1726186). Edit - bug was fixed in version 96\n2. Nvidia users out of luck (for now)\n\n# Chromium\n\nChromium also supports hardware acceleration in x11 and wayland. This too was tested in chromium-dev 97. To enable it, first set `chrome://flags/#ignore-gpu-blocklist` to `disabled`. Then launch chromium with following flags:\n\n    --use-gl=desktop --enable-features=VaapiVideoDecoder\n\nIn theory, `--use-gl=desktop` should not be required in wayland, but I couldn't get it to work without it. Also h.264ify will be required as stated above.\n\nWhat works:\n\n1. both 30fps/60fps or higher videos play smoothly at resolutions supported by gpu decoder, unless vulkan backend is enabled through flags. However there is little reason to enable it for now\n2. Videos are played colour accurately\n\nThe problems:\n\n1. CPU usage reduction is minimal. I could not observe significant improvement in reduction of cpu load or improved battery life ( on different machine) despite confirming that hardware video acceleration was working while playing videos\n2. Nvidia users out of luck again\n\n# Epiphany/Gnome Web\n\nBased on GTKwebkit, it provides another option for users that may be not as powerful as chrome or firefox, but still fairly usable for modern web. To enable hardware accelerated video, first install `gstreamer-vaapi` for amd/intel gpus or `gst-plugins-bad` and `nvidia-utils` for nvidia GPUs. Then run:\n\n    gsettings set org.gnome.Epiphany.web:/ hardware-acceleration-policy 'always'\n\nWhat works:\n\n1. both 30fps/60fps or higher videos play smoothly at resolutions supported by gpu decoder\n2. Videos are colour accurate\n3. Works for nvidia users\n4. Good reduction in CPU usage\n\nThe problems:\n\n1. Lack of extensions\n2. No simple way to limit video codec to h.264, hence older GPUs will lack hardware video acceleration in most videos with codecs other than h.264\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nCompared to windows, where hardware video acceleration is enabled by default in most hardware, the same needs to be set up in linux and compromises needed to be made. I find little reason to enable hardware video acceleration in chrome, since it fails to do the single most important function of saving cpu resources. In case of firefox, there is some benefit, but one has to bear with washed out, dull videos.\n\nThe best method currently to enjoy online videos is setting to launch either VLC or MPV when video is played in any of these browsers. It will lower CPU utilization greater than firefox, and videos will be colour accurate. However thanks to DRM streaming services and custom video players that are abundant online, this approach is applicable only to some websites.\n\nIn case some users are aware about workarounds, do post in comments.\n\nEdit: many commenters claim that the bug mentioned above for firefox does not affect them. I couldn't find anything different in configs, so it may be related to some specific hardware. In that case, firefox may currently be the best browser on linux for playing online videos\n\nEdit2: Added Gnome web/Epiphany on advice of u/rayi512x\n\n**Edit 3:** [**Bug 1726186**](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1726186) **in firefox has been resolved in version 96. This alleviates almost all problems with firefox except good nvidia support, making it ideal for amd and intel users**",

    "body": "\\[RESOLVED\\]\n\nI managed to get this resolved. Sadly, it is completely anticlimactic and not at all the fancy, whimsical issue I was hoping to delight you all with. Nevertheless, I am truly grateful for all the help I have received here. Thank you!  \n**tldr:** it was a cronjob, but not one in the OS, in the zyxel software, and it was misbehaving;\n\n**Longer version:** I went all \"10 second tom\" on ita nd dug through the files, seconds at a time. Mostly everybody pointed at a job/scheduler thing - so when I was digging through /tmp a file named  scheduler.log stood out. crawling through through it I found references to a zyxel utility (`/usr/bin/zydbcli`). Called it and got a help screen. Then called `/usr/bin/zydbcli --queryschall`   \nand low and behold, there was a job in there to reboot the nas every first Tuesday of the month at 8:00 am. Which fiit the bill, since it went into a boot loop yesterday. Removed that using the same utility, and the boot loop has stopped, effectively resolving the issue. Again, this does not show up in crontab (for any user) so I'm writing this off as an issue with zyxel's software, and will sotp wasting everybody's time.  \nAgain, many, many thanks!\n\nOriginal post &gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nYes, you read that right. Every year, in December, my small linux box goes into a continous boot loop. Sometime after New Year it will start working normally like nothing ever happenned.\n\nOk, now let me give you a little background. I'm a developer, so I have a technical background but sysadmin stuff is not my strong suit. This is a Zyxel NSA320 NAS which, after installing some package from its interface is now also running some minimalistic linux. I get command line access (ssh) and have transmission and minidlna running on it - nothing more. It's basically a torrentbox/mediacenter.\n\nWhat I found is that it is actually accessible via ssh for a few seconds before rebooting. 5-10 seconds at most. So I could potentially run predefined command or script on it and get its output.\n\nFirst time it happenned, I almost wrote it off as broken until it just started working again. This is now the 4th year it's doing this - and I figured why not, this is an odd enough thing, somebody might actually enjoy troubleshooting this (I know I will).I've tried the usual poweroff, completely unplug, even disconnected from the network entirely, re-seated the HDD inside (out of desperation). To no availa, when december comes, it goes on vacation.\n\nI'm at a loss here - don't even know where to start. Is anybody kind enough or curious enough to give this a try?\n\nLE: spellchecksedit 1: Managed to do a ps -ef right before getting kicked out.

There is no particular problem regarding Windows that made me switch to Linux though: one day I woke up and had nothing to do so I thought it would be cool to try something new with my computer, so I did and discorvered an awesome world and liked it so much that I stayed.\n\nWindows 10 worked just fine on my pc, never had any problems (beside one time when I turned on my laptop only to descover that my OS was broken and there was nothing I could do about it, but still...) and I'm sure that, besides all the unwanted software that it comes with and other things that you can modify to make the OS function better, there surely is some good in it!\n\nI personally like windows and still do and, even if this is difficult to admit, I even switched from Chrome to the new Edge when it came out cause it worked better, at least on my system.\n\nRemember, I'm not trying to say windows is better, because imo it's not and I use Linux for everything that it's not Netflix/Prime (untill they let us have HD streaming) and some games that are not yet available on Linux, but I still can't understand where all this hate comes from.  \n\n\nSo what are your thoughts about this?

    "body": "I have been using linux for 10 months now after using windows for my entire life.\n\nIn the beginning, I thought that files are just what programs use e.g. Notepad (.txt), Photoshop etc and the extension of the file will define its purpose. Like I couldn't open a video in a paint file\n\nOnce I started using Linux, I began to realise that the purpose of files is not defined by their extension, and its the program that decides how to read a file.\n\nFor example I can use Node to run .js files but when I removed the extension it still continued to work\n\nExtensions are basically only for semantic purposes it seems, but arent really required\n\nWhen I switched from Ubuntu to Arch, having to manually setup my partitions during the installation I took notice of how my volumes e.g. /dev/sda were also *just files*, I tried opening them in neovim only to see nothing inside. \n\nBut somehow that emptiness stores the information required for my file systems\n\nIn linux literally everything is a file, it seems. Files store some metadata like creation date, permissions, etc.\n\nThis makes me feel like a file can be thought of as an HTML document, where the &lt;head&gt; contains all the metadata of the file and the &lt;body&gt; is what we see when we open it with a text editor, would this be a correct way to think about them?\n\nIs there anything in linux that is *not* a file? \n\nIf everything is a file, then to run those files we need some sort of executable (compiler etc.) which in itself will be a file. There needs to be some sort of \"initial file\" that will be loaded which allows us to load the next file and so on to get the system booted. (e.g. a the \"spark\" which causes the \"explosion\")\n\nHow can this initial file be run if there is no files loaded before this file? Would this mean the CPU is able to execute the file directly on raw metal or what? I just cant believe that in linux literally everything is a file. I wonder if Windows is the same, is this fundamentally how operating systems work?\n\nIn the context of the HTML example what would a binary file look like? I always thought if I opened a binary file I would see 01011010, but I don't. What the heck is a file?",

I started to answer until I had to think and say \"I'm actually not sure, because they want to?\". I did some googling and couldnt find anyone laying out even one reason for it. Maybe someone here could spell it out for me.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for all of the answers and explanations.

Also, I realize that in my post I'm praising Linux like it's the second coming of Christ even though I have not even used it yet. I later realize that Linux may not be the best OS ever made that I thought it was but I'm still going to try it out.

    "body": "TL; DR - My desktop went from a disgusting mess to completely empty.\n\nI switched from using only Windows my whole life to Linux full-time about a year ago, and a big change for me was using a file structure that actually made sense. Basically, I'd spent all of my years participating in the disgusting practice of: 1) Accumulate a bunch of files on your desktop. 2) When your desktop becomes too full, create a New Folder, and throw it all in there. 3) Repeat until you have half a dozen New Folders on your desktop. 4) Create one more New Folder, put all the others inside that. 5) Repeat.\n\nThe biggest reason for that was probably just that the file structures didn't make much sense to me on Windows. Yeah, if you opened the file manager, there were Pictures, Videos, etc. on the left, but trying to figure out what was actually going on was weird to me. Had to go to the top level where Program Files and what not were, then Users, then choose my account out of a handful of other options that were there despite me being the only user, then you find the Desktop, Documents, etc., along with a bunch of other folders and files I'd never seen before. Why bother with all that when I can just stay comfy on the Desktop and Downloads folders?\n\nSwitching to Linux, I took the time to actually learn the file structures and why most of the directories were there, on root and user levels, and things made sense to me. Like, it makes sense that `/home/kavb333/` is my user's home directory, where my Desktop, Documents, etc. are, and it makes sense that my .config, .cache, etc. would be there, too. Of course the high level user stuff is just at `~/&lt;here&gt;` because that's the home directory. So after I made the switch, I took a day or two out of my time to go through the disgusting war crime I committed over the years to my desktop, and put things into the directories they actually belong, and now my Desktop is almost always empty.",

This may be because the hardware is optimised more for Windows, but even when it comes to gesture support beyond 2 finger scrolling, every solution I've found maps gestures to keyboard shortcuts. This is good in a vacuum, but when gestures on Windows and Macs feel a lot better integrated (instead of the scrolling action feeling incremental, the action on-screen directly correlates to your finger movement, down to the smallest movement), it makes me wonder why Linux seems to be so behind in this regard. In order for Linux to truly become a mainstream competitor to Windows and Mac, in my opinion, a competitive trackpad is essential.\n\nThis isn't me bashing Linux; I love the UI customisability and genuinely want the adoption of Linux to grow - I'm just curious out of concern; what's limiting the Linux trackpad?",

I had a bit of trouble, but after resetting my BIOS, it's working just fine now. \n\nOne thing I'm enjoying so far is that my computer is not overheating like it did with Windows. Been playing videos and making video calls. Barely any warmth with a quiet fan now. On Windows 10, my computer would get super hot on the top and bottom with a loud fan. That alone is worth the switch. \n\nI also retained pinch to zoom functionality for my trackpad which is great. I use that feature a lot. It's what stopped me from switching to Linux years ago when I was considering it. Luckily with Fedora, it still works.\n\nThanks to everyone who commented to help me. I'm excited to learn more about the wonders of Linux.  \n\n\n\n\nOriginal: The other night I did an update for Windows 10. I regret it so much. My laptop won't turn on properly. When it finally did load, it ran horribly. \n\n I tried to rollback before the updates but the OS is running so shitty, I can even get to the settings to see if there's a rollback available. \n\nSo now I'm like, fuck it. Let's give Linux a try. I tried years ago, but I had issues finding a distro  that let me do pinch and zoom with my trackpad. Now I don't care about that anymore. I need a working laptop with an OS that doesn't terrify me everytime there's an update. I blocked Windows updates for almost 2 years because it fucked up my computer last time. This time is even worse. \n\n\nI'm not a computer expert but I can read and follow directions pretty well. I've done things like install custom ROMs on my phones without bricking them. A lil effort to get my tech to work won't scare me. Though I prefer something that's simple to use for newbies. I need to be able to get online and have my camera and mic working properly out the box so I can work. Give me that and I'll figure out the rest as I go. \n\nI have a Thinkpad X240 if that matters.",

Also someone sells some piece of hardware that might do it for $10,000 and data recovery labs have those.  Anyway, if you pay a lab thousands of dollars, they might be able to help (this isn't out of the question, just I like to hack things and we'd like to NOT spend thousands if we can avoid it).\n\n**5)** There is a master password which may still work.

During the conversation, this exchange took place:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&gt; I don't wanna wear out the battery by plugging it in. \n\nAh, okay, now I get it. I hate to tell you this, but here are the facts of battery life:\n\n* Not plugging in your laptop except to recharge the battery **wears out your battery**.\n\n* But plugging in your laptop -- leaving your laptop plugged in most of the time -- **does not wear out your battery**. \n\nAn intelligent laptop battery charger only charges the battery to about 80% *in the long term* (depending on the battery type), then maintains that charge level, neither adding to nor subtracting from the charge level. In the short term the charger provide 100% charge, but over a longer period, this charge level is allowed to decline.\n\nWhen the laptop is plugged in, when it's in use, *all the power comes from the charger, not the battery*. So the battery, neither being charged nor discharged, has a very long life.\n\nIf the laptop is not plugged in when in use, the battery must provide all the operating power, and that power must be replaced periodically. This means the battery is constantly being charged and discharged, *which substantially shortens the battery's life.*\n\nA battery's service lifetime is measured by how many charge/discharge cycles it can tolerate. *If you want to wear out your battery, by all means force it to charge and discharge every day.* The best way to destroy your laptop's battery is to use it without line power, then plug it in and force a recharge, every day.\n\nIf you do this, the computer manufacturers will love you, because you'll be replacing your laptops like clockwork, especially now that new-laptop batteries can't even be accessed/removed/replaced any more.\n\nADDENDUM: This is true for electric cars also:\n\n[Electric car battery life: how to preserve your battery](https://www.drivingelectric.com/your-questions-answered/96/electric-car-battery-life-how-preserve-your-battery) : \"A battery expert on a Tesla forum (with a PhD in electromechanical engineering) recommends keeping your state of charge between 15% and 90%, others 25%-75%, but advice varies. Some say 20%-80%, but fundamentally, the rule is don’t overcharge it or let it go completely flat.\"\n\nOne may ask what relevance electric car batteries have for laptop batteries. As it turns out, they're the same batteries, just more of them.\n\n[ Removed background reference -- not really relevant, after all. ]\n\nEDIT: clarification and other changes.",

From what I read, it seems like it hasn't, but I thought maybe I was just getting biased information.  \n\nI got a new laptop without a discrete GPU, so there's no reason I couldn't run Linux on it for everything.  It's got a second M.2 slot, so I could buy one and try a Linux desktop again without much trouble.  I just don't want to waste my time if the situation is still as it was in 2013:  \"usable but buggy and inconsistent with no real advantage over Windows.\"\n\nedit:  VirtualBox didn't work as well as I'd hoped so I installed Arch after shrinking my Windows partition by 64GB.

Again, for a media server, I’ve found that running in Docker can negatively affect ability to transcode and access all threads/core of the processor. I’m curious if running via a Snap also eats up more resources and affects performance since all the files needed are installed in the Snap (even if they are already installed outside of it).

I have also Emacs installed, which dates back to 1984 (?), if I'm not mistaken. I'm still learning it. When it comes to terminal emulators I've tried, and still have installed XTerm, from the 80s, but I'm on unknown ground with it and I don't think I'll replace my current terminal emulator (Terminator) with it.\n\nWhat about you? What is the oldest piece of software that you guys still use on your GNU/Linux machines? Is it still maintained?\n\nI'm very curious to hear your answers because I really like to explore and experiment with software, especially if it was developed and used during in the 70s and 80s!",

This is enough to develop with I am concerned trying to run a virtual machine on it might push it over the edge.\n\nAs Linux users have been so supportive of my previous game I would hate to delay the launch of the Linux version. I am, therefore, in the search of a hero who wouldn't mind installing a beta version of the game via a steam key and giving it a spin. As I say I'd only need you to boot it up, and making sure it doesn't crash for a while and as a (small) reward you would of course be allowed to keep the game as well as play it before anyone else in the world, and (more importantly) have my eternal gratitude.\n\nI have 5 keys to giveaway on a first come first serve basis to whomever comments, it would be helpful if you could include your discords as well just to speed up communication.\n\nYou can find the trailer at the top of my post history if you are interested but need a little push.\n\nMany thanks!\n\nEdit:\n\nFirstly, can I just say what an awesome community this is and a big thank you to everyone who's reached out offering to help. Unfortunately, I have given out all of the codes already. For those of you still interested in the game I'll leave a link here to the store page, you'll be able to get your hands on it fully tested and non-buggy on 5th of Feb for only $8: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1510800/The\\_Great\\_Plague\\_Exodus/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1510800/The_Great_Plague_Exodus/)\n\nThank you all once again.",

I mean, I use proprietary software for the sake of ease, for example I’m a gamer and I have an Nvidia GPU, I have no other choice but to either switch back to Windows to get the best performance in games, or use proprietary drivers which is really not a huge deal for me. I’m in for the pragmatism of getting things done with the best tools available FOSS or not, before sacrificing ease of use for restricting myself to it.\n\nWhat’s your reasoning behind this?

    "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m not a real sysadmin or anything. I’ve just always been the “computer guy” in my grad lab and at a couple jobs. We’ve got a few shared machines that everyone uses, and it’s a constant problem where someone runs a big job, eats all the RAM or CPU, and the whole thing crashes for everyone else.\n\nI tried using systemdspawner with JupyterHub for a while, and it actually worked really well. Users had to sign out a set amount of resources and were limited by systemd. The problem was that people figured out they could just SSH into the server and bypass all the limits.\n\nI looked into schedulers like SLURM, but that felt like overkill for what I needed. What I really wanted was basically systemdspawner, but for everything a user does on the system, not just Jupyter sessions.\n\nSo I ended up building something called fairshare. The idea was simple: the admin sets a default (like 1 CPU and 2 GB RAM per user), and users can check how many resources are available and request more. Systemd enforces the limits automatically so people can’t hog everything.\n\nNot sure if this is something others would find useful, but it’s been great for me so far. Just figured I’d share in case anyone else is dealing with the same shared server headaches.\n\nhttps://github.com/WilliamJudge94/fairshare/tree/main",

I think that this answer is not correct because while some major distro can do the work without problem there are some of them that do thing in the right way.\n\nI'm asking because on several ISP when I create a VPS in the list appears first AlmaLinux/RockyLinux (and in notes is reported for professional usage) and then Debian and Ubuntu but every time I read about server distro suggestions, Debian is the most suggested, followed by EL derivatives like AlmaLinux and RockyLinux but this could not reflect the real situation on industry because many reports also home/homelab usage that is a bit different from real production server.\n\nSpeaking of paid support distro RHEL is the king and there is no doubt about this but what about the other?\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nEdit: many told to avoid EL distro except cases where the software requires them",

    "title": "Six new CVEs related to rsync",
    "body": "Rsync, a versatile file-synchronizing tool, contains six vulnerabilities present within versions 3.3.0 and below. Rsync can be used to sync files between remote and local computers, as well as storage devices. The discovered vulnerabilities include heap-buffer overflow, information leak, file leak, external directory file-write,–safe-links bypass, and symbolic-link race condition.\nDescription\n\nMany backup programs, such as Rclone, DeltaCopy, and ChronoSync use Rsync as backend software for file synchronization. Rsync can also be used in Daemon mode and is widely used in in public mirrors to synchronize and distribute files efficiently across multiple servers.\nFollowing are the discovered vulnerabilities:\n\n**CVE-2024-12084** A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in the Rsync daemon results in improper handling of attacker-controlled checksum lengths (s2length). When the MAX_DIGEST_LEN exceeds the fixed SUM_LENGTH (16 bytes), an attacker can write out-of-bounds in the sum2 buffer.\n\n**CVE-2024-12085** When Rsync compares file checksums, a vulnerability in the Rsync daemon can be triggered. An attacker could manipulate the checksum length (s2length) to force a comparison between the checksum and uninitialized memory and leak one byte of uninitialized stack data at a time.\n\n**CVE-2024-12086** A vulnerability in the Rsync daemon could cause a server to leak the contents of arbitrary files from clients’ machines. This happens when files are copied from client to server. During the process, a malicious Rsync server can generate invalid communication tokens and checksums from data the attacker compares. The comparison will trigger the client to ask the server to resend data, which the server can use to guess a checksum. The server could then reprocess data, byte to byte, to determine the contents of the target file.\n\n**CVE-2024-12087** A path traversal vulnerability in the Rsync daemon affects the --inc-recursive option, a default-enabled option for many flags that can be enabled by the server even if not explicitly enabled by the client. When using this option, a lack of proper symlink verification coupled with de-duplication checks occurring on a per-file-list basis could allow a server to write files outside of the client's intended destination directory. A malicious server could remotely trigger this activity by exploiting symbolic links named after valid client directories/paths.\n\n**CVE-2024-12088** A --safe-links option vulnerability results in Rsync failing to properly verify whether the symbolic link destination contains another symbolic link within it. This results in a path traversal vulnerability, which may lead to arbitrary files being written outside of the desired directory.\n\n**CVE-2024-12747** Rsync is vulnerable to a symbolic-link race condition, which may lead to privilege escalation. A user could gain access to privileged files on affected servers.\nImpact\n\nWhen combined, the first two vulnerabilities (heap buffer overflow and information leak) allow a client to execute arbitrary code on a device that has an Rsync server running. The client requires only anonymous read-access to the server, such as public mirrors. Additionally, attackers can take control of a malicious server and read/write arbitrary files of any connected client. Sensitive data, such as SSH keys, can be extracted, and malicious code can be executed by overwriting files such as ~/.bashrc or ~/.popt.\nSolution\n\nApply the latest patches available at https://github.com/RsyncProject/rsync and https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/src/. Users should run updates on their software as soon as possible. As Rsync can be distributed bundled, ensure any software that provides such updates is also kept current to address these vulnerabilities.\n\nhttps://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/952657",

One day, I had this paranoia that what if we lost access to our Google Workspace due to some vendor abnormalities (which is not even rare to happen).\n\nSo I built this open source tool that helps individuals and organizations to archive their whole email inboxes with the ability to index and search these emails. \n\nThe tool is called Open Archiver, and it has the ability to archive emails from cloud-based email inboxes, including Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, and all IMAP-enabled email inboxes. You can connect it to your email provider, and it copies every single incoming and outgoing email into a secure archive that you control (Your local storage or S3-compatible storage).\n\nHere are some of the main features:\n\n* **Comprehensive archiving:** It doesn't just import emails; it indexes the full content of both the messages and common attachments.\n* **Organization-Wide backup:** It handles multi-user environments, so you can connect it to your Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 tenant and **back up every user's mailbox**.\n* **Powerful full-text search:** There's a clean web UI with a high-performance search engine, letting you dig through the entire archive (messages and attachments included) quickly.\n* **You control the storage:** You have full control over where your data is stored. The storage backend is pluggable, supporting your local filesystem or S3-compatible object storage right out of the box.\n* **API-Driven:** The whole application is built on a REST API, so you can integrate with it programmatically if you need to.\n\nYou can find the project on GitHub (Demo site available): [https://github.com/LogicLabs-OU/OpenArchiver](https://github.com/LogicLabs-OU/OpenArchiver)\n\nWould love any feedback you may have, I'm open to discussions!",

    "body": "Passed the lfcs with a score of 84.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo I originally did this exam back in I think 2018 along with the lfce. I was a VMware and storage admin at the time and worked a lot with centos 5/6/7.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI then left that role and didn't really do much hands on with Linux unless just looking at log files and basic stuff like that.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm about to change jobs and I really wanted to get my baseline back again, so decided to renew my lfcs.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe exam has changed a lot since I did it back then. It's now it's vendor agnostic, you can't pick if you want to use Ubuntu or centos, so the task is yours to complete how you want. I only realised this a bit later on as I was planning to use firewall-cmd for firewalling but when I realised I just swapped back to using iptables.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow there is GIT and Docker basics as well. The usual LVM, cron, NTP, users,ssh, limits, certs, find etc is all in there as you'd expect. I missed one question because I got a bit stuck and just skipped it, I had about 20mins at the end , I went back and just couldn't be bothered and called it a day. In real life I would have used Google to assist me tbh 😂\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI signed up to kodekloud because they had an lfcs course but also kubernetes stuff, their course is decent and so are their mock exams, sometimes their labs are a bit hit n miss but their forum support is pretty solid.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI'm also a big fan of zanders training, I used it extensively back in 2018 as that's all there was, his videos are short and sweet, he gives you a task to do in your own lab and then shows you how he did it. So I used his more recent training as well and he is still the go to, I'd use his stuff over kodekloud but kodekloud give you proper labs as well, so swings and roundabouts as they say. Kodekloud are Ubuntu focused and Zander is more centos and he touches in Ubuntu a bit, but the takeaway is find out how to do it without the distro specific tools.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIn the kodekloud labs the scoring is a bit debatable, one question said sort out NTP and didn't give any further details, I used chrony and got zero marks, they wanted me to use systemd-timesyncd but another question in another lab said specifically to use timesyncd, also in crontab if I used mon,thu instead of 1,4 I'd get marked down even though both are valid.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs part of cyber Monday I took the exam deal for the lfcs and part of buying the exam is you get the killer.sh labs. That lab was eye opening I did not do well on my first run through, I got 35/75. Just time management and spending too much time rummaging through Man even after all that training and lab work. So I then worked through the questions multiple times over the 36hr window you get per go and got faster at finding things. The killer.sh lab is defo harder than the actual exam so if you can get through that…you're gonna pass the exam.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI noticed people mentioned installing tldr, so I used that in the kodekloud labs and in the actual exams, it does install but you get a couple of errors you have to work through, but it's great for syntax. A few people mentioned curl cheat.sh and that is great but I don't think itd be allowed as the exam guidelines say you can use Man and anything that can be installed, also I wasn't keen on typing out cheat.sh in an actual exam lol, but for real life it's a great resource for sure.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHope this helps anyone thinking of studying for it and taking the exam.",

I've been dog fooding it (on top of systemd, mind you... ripping systemd out entirely would be a lot of work) for several months with more varied use cases than I expected and it's been holding up great. If there's two other distinguishing features, they're:\n\n- It has (imo) a much much simpler dependency model: there are only \"strong\" and \"weak\" dependencies, one direction (dependee to dependent)\n\n- Puteron will never turn something off you turned on. Like, if some service fails several times, or some device disappears, or etc etc systemd will turn the service off, effectively overwriting your preferences. In Puteron the state you set is separate from the operating state and the state you set is never touched by Puteron itself.\n\nThere have been lots of discussions about systemd's controversial encroachment, so I thought a new contender might be interesting.",

    "body": "(Before someone says it: I'm talking about supernumerary hard links, where multiple file paths point to the same inode. I know every file is a hard link lol)\n\nLately I've been exploring what's possible with `rsync --inplace`, but the manual warned that hard links in the dest can throw a wrench in the works. That got me thinking: are hard links even worth the trouble in the modern day? Especially if the filesystem supports reflinks.\n\nI think the biggest hazards with hard links are:\n* When a change to one file is unexpectedly reflected in \"different\" file(s), because they're actually the same file (and this is harder to discover than with symlinks).\n* When you _want_ two (or more) files to change in lockstep, but one day a \"change\" turns out to be a delete-and-replace which breaks the connection.\n\nAnd then I got curious, and ran `find -links +1` on my daily driver. `/usr/share/` in particular turned up ~2000 supernumerary hard links (~3000 file paths minus the ~1000 inodes they pointed to), saving a whopping ~30MB of space. I don't understand the benefit, why not make them symlinks or just copies?\n\nThe one truly good use I've heard is [this old comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/cue7g2/comment/extntsl/), assuming your filesystem doesn't support reflinks.",

The filesystems are XFS on nvme drives.\n\nWe recently noticed that the /boot partition on one of the machines was 100% full according to df.  It's a 1GB partition, but du /boot shows that it contains only 51MB of files.  Checking all the other machines, we see that /boot has various levels of usage from around 11% up to 80%, even though they all contain the exact same set of files (same number of files, same sizes, same timestamps)\n\nWe thought maybe a process was holding open a deleted file and not freeing up the space, but lsof shows no open files and it persists through a reboot.\n\nWe booted from a recovery disk to check if there were any files in /boot before it gets mounted, nothing there.\n\nWe ran fsck.xfs and it came up clean.\n\nThere are plenty of free inodes.\n\nOn the one that was at 100%, we deleted a couple of the older kernels and it dropped down to 95%, but over the past week it has slowly crept back up to 100% with no new files, no changes in file sizes, and no changed timestamps.  24 hours ago it was at 97%, today 100%.\n\nIs there perhaps some sort of metadata in play that we can't see?  If so, is there a way to see it?  It seems unlikely that it could account for a discrepancy of almost a gig (51MB vs 1GB)\n\nAny other ideas?",

I used Debian in the past and this was included with the kernel package, but my current distribution does not provide this. [https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/ChangeLog-6.12.4](https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/ChangeLog-6.12.4) is too verbose, so I asked ChatGPT for a detailed summary, but I felt the summary was still too generalized.

The linux support side deals with client implementations, bug fixes, and a lot of customer hand holding and teaching people how to use linux in the first place. It's a glorified application support role and the hour long meetings teaching people how to use the software I'm not terribly excited about in the first place is getting to me mentally. I do work from home and it's the best job I've had since I started my career 12 years ago, but I don't want to get left behind. The team is silo'd, has no devops culture and you can't get promoted internally. Most people here have had families and have worked together for decades are content to stay where they are until they retire.\n\nI have 12 years of overall professional IT experience and over 20 years of self learning experience. This has ranged from deep engagement with online communities and preservation to building internal automation tools and scalable media applications for fun. I am trying to navigate to a zero or mostly zero client interaction job and just have a team that would like my help in building applications, or working on automating internal tools inside a larger company.\n\nI enjoy building applications in react, python, and docker. I have an active github and am actively searching/learning/building. What should my next move be?\n\nI am guessing an internal linux admin at a larger org that would get me involved with k8s some professional CI/CD and devops stuff. More hands on cloud (which I have very little exp in).\n\ndevops/SRE - seems like this is a step above linux admin that may require k8s knowledge and professional software dev experience. I've seen many roles state you need professional software development experience. Sometimes years of it.\n\nSearch for a junior level software dev job or be willing to take a paycut.\n\nIf you were in my shoes or made this transition please share any stories or tips you may have for me.

    "body": "Our site has many CentOS7, Rocky8/9 linux systems that are shared by many users concurrently via ssh login for random interactive uses.  Many of these are large 128GB+ desktops at one person in a a groups desk where that person logins in person but many other users in the group SSH in to that desktop to run various analysis programs and development.\n\nAnyway, one thing that happens a lot is one user will run a MATLAB or other program that consuses all the RAM in the box slowing it down to a crawl for all others.  Eventually the kernel implements its OOM procedure.  However, many system processes, though not killed by the OOM procedure get in a stuck non-operating state.  \n\nOne of these is SSSD the main account services daemon which does not recover and then prevents any new logins and hangs other processes on things like user name/id lookups.   One can restart sssd to fix it but one cannot ssh to the box or even login locally to do this.  So most of the time we have to hard powercycle the box.\n\nOne attempt I made at \"fixing\" this was to create the following rsyslog configuration in /etc/rsyslog.d/oom-sssd-restart.conf\n\n`:msg, contains, \"was terminated by own WATCHDOG\" ^/usr/etc/sssd-restart.sh`\n\nas one usually sees that message in /var/log/messages when sssd gets in its hung state but this has only worked about 50% of the time\n\nUltimately, I want to make sure that 4GB or so of the RAM of each system is reserved only for system processes (UID &lt; 1000) or just limit RAM to 96% of the systems ram to users with UID &gt; 1000.    Is there any simple and accepted way to do this?   I am NOT looking for a per user memory limit via the  /etc/security/limits.d/ system.    That does not work for what I want.\n\nOne thing I am looking at is using cgroup slices and running\n\n`systemctl set-property user.slice MemoryHigh=120G`\n\nfor example on a 128G system.  It is unclear to me if this requires cgroups v2 meaning changing GRUB on all boxes to have kernel paramater systemd.unified\\_cgroup\\_hierarchy=1 and rebooting them.\n\nBTW, I do use SLURM on a HPC cluster and consider that a too heavy handed and difficult solution for an interactive user desktop shared by users where local GUI login is used.\n\n  \n",

In any case this is obviously not the correct way to do this.\n\nI was thinking that I could switch the secret manager to some cloud-based alternative but it feels like I would face the same problem; how and where to save the API key to access to the keys behind cloud?\n\nHelp is greatly appreciated.\n\nEDIT: I add some missing context to here as well instead of just the comment:\n\nI am syncing a local mail server with a remote one by using `mbsync`.\n\n`mbsync` needs to pass credentials to both of these server. Here is a snippet of fetching username for remote server:\n\n```\nUserCmd \"secret-tool lookup remote\\_mail\\_server username\"\n```\n\nAnd the current keyring is the `gnome-keyring`.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI got it to work through fiddling with env-vars but this is definitely not the way this is supposed to be done. As a starter this is would not work in a headless environment, so I am really curious to hear the proper ways to deal with authentication in cronjobs",

At first, it seems like they are just the normal annoying scanners that are going to check for open ports and then go away.  However, once they find an open port. more and more of them show up until it's thousands of them.  Some of them connect, and hold the TCP port open as long as possible.  Others just connect and disconnect quickly (but thousands of them).  This prevents all of the services on that port from being available.\n\nFor example, I am building a simple LAMP application with website and database, all on one server.  Since I would connect to the database from my home IP, I let it accept connections that were not local.\n\nOne day, my application is not working.  I check and it can't connect to the database.  I check the database and all the connections are taken up by these bots.  I firewall off everything but my home IP from that port.\n\nThen, the website stops working.  Apache is configured for 512 connections and they are all taken up by these bots.  I moved everything to a different port temporarily.\n\nThis application isn't even public yet and has nothing visible without logging in.  There is no reason they'd be targeting me in particular.\n\nI guess I will have to put the final website behind a proxy service like cloudflare.

    "body": "**Hi everyone,**\n\nIn this video, I’ll walk you through a side project I’ve been working on that showcases some of Keycloak’s powerful capabilities. (I couldn't upload the video here as it getting shortened and blocked by auto bot. You can still see project demo video on the link reported)\n\nOne key architectural aspect: when a user logs in via SSH, **no local user account is created on the VM** — meaning there's **no footprint left in the** `/etc/passwd` **file**. Identity resolution (e.g., UID mapping) is handled dynamically by a **custom NSS (Name Service Switch) module**, which translates the required user data at runtime.\n\nAuthentication is handled through a **custom PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module)** built specifically for this project. Unlike typical approaches that rely on embedding a client ID and secret from the Keycloak instance on each VM (such as what's done in `pam-keycloak-oidc`), this design avoids scattering sensitive credentials or configuration across multiple machines.\n\nInstead, the PAM module only requires a **proxy URL**, which acts as a secure intermediary between the SSH VM and the Keycloak instance. This centralizes all communication, simplifies configuration, and ensures a clean, scalable, and secure setup — especially useful in environments with many VMs.\n\nIn this scenario, we’re using a local user account created directly in Keycloak. When the user logs in via SSH with their password, they’re prompted to select a multi-factor authentication (MFA) method. In this case, WebAuthn with fingerprint authentication is used. Once configured, the user is successfully authenticated.\n\nHowever, after login, the user still cannot perform any actions — because no permissions have been granted yet in Keycloak. We then assign **read-write permissions**, and those changes take effect **in real time**, even in the **currently active session**. There's no need for the user to log out and back in — updated permissions are applied immediately.\n\nLater, we remove those permissions, and — again in real time — the user instantly loses the ability to write or delete.\n\nAnother feature implemented in this project is **automatic onboarding and registration of external Identity Provider (IdP) users** into the Keycloak instance upon SSH login.\n\nFor example, if a user like `user@google.co`m — not yet known to the Keycloak instance — initiates an SSH connection, they are automatically registered, prompted to configure MFA, and then follow the same real-time permission model as local users.\n\nI’ll be showcasing that part in an upcoming post — stay tuned!",

    "body": "**The sysadmin dilemma:** You've got secrets that are too critical for regular password managers but need long-term secure storage. What's your strategy?\n\n**Examples of what I'm talking about:**\n\n* **Backup encryption master keys:** Your Borg/Restic/Duplicity passphrases protecting TBs of production data\n* **Root CA private keys:** Internal PKI that can't be rotated without breaking everything\n* **LUKS master keys:** Full disk encryption for archived/offline systems\n* **Break-glass admin credentials:** Emergency root access when LDAP/SSO is down\n* **GPG signing keys:** Package signing, release management keys\n* **Legacy system passwords:** That one ancient system nobody wants to touch\n\n**The problem:** These aren't daily-use secrets you can rotate easily. Some protect years of irreplaceable data. Single points of failure (hardware tokens, encrypted files in one location) make me nervous.\n\n**Links:**\n\n* GitHub: [https://github.com/katvio/fractum](https://github.com/katvio/fractum)\n* Security architecture: [https://fractum.katvio.com/security-architecture/](https://fractum.katvio.com/security-architecture/)\n\n**Our approach - mathematical secret splitting:**\n\nWe built a tool using Shamir's Secret Sharing to eliminate single points of failure:\n\n    # Example: Split your backup master key into 5 pieces, need 3 to recover\n    docker run --rm -it --network=none \\\n      -v \"$(pwd)/data:/data\" \\\n      -v \"$(pwd)/shares:/app/shares\" \\\n      fractum-secure encrypt /data/backup-master-key.txt \\\n      --threshold 3 --shares 5 --label \"borg-backup-master\"\n\n**Our distribution strategy:**\n\n* **Primary datacenter:** 1 share in secure server room safe\n* **Secondary datacenter:** 1 share in DR site (different geographic region)\n* **Corporate office:** 1 share in executive-level fire safe\n* **Off-site security:** 1 share in bank safety deposit box\n* **Key personnel:** 1 share with senior team lead (encrypted personal storage)\n\n**Recovery scenarios:** Any 3 of 5 locations accessible = full recovery. Accounts for site disasters, personnel changes, and business continuity requirements.\n\n**Why this beats traditional approaches:**\n\n✅ **Air-gapped operation:** Docker `--network=none` guarantees no data exfiltration  \n✅ **Self-contained recovery:** Each share includes the complete application  \n✅ **Cross-platform:** Works on any Linux distro, Windows, macOS  \n✅ **Mathematical security:** Information-theoretic, not just \"computationally hard\"  \n✅ **No vendor dependency:** Open source, works forever\n\n**Real-world scenarios this handles:**\n\n🔥 **Office fire:** Other shares remain secure  \n🚪 **Personnel changes:** Don't depend on one person knowing where keys are hidden  \n💾 **Hardware failure:** USB token dies, but shares let you recover  \n🏢 **Site disasters:** Distributed shares across geographic locations  \n📦 **Legacy migrations:** Old systems with irreplaceable encrypted data\n\n**Technical details:**\n\n* Built on Adi Shamir's 1979 algorithm (same math Trezor uses)\n* AES-256-GCM encryption + threshold cryptography\n* Each share is a self-contained ZIP with recovery tools\n* Works completely offline, no network dependencies\n* FIPS 140-2 compatible algorithms\n\n**For Linux admins specifically:**\n\nThe Docker approach means you can run this on any system without installing dependencies. Perfect for air-gapped environments or when you need to recover on a system you don't control.\n\n    # Recovery is just as simple:\n    docker run --rm -it --network=none \\\n      -v \"$(pwd)/shares:/app/shares\" \\\n      -v \"$(pwd)/output:/data\" \\\n      fractum-secure decrypt /data/backup-master-key.txt.enc\n\n**Question for the community:** How do you currently handle long-term storage of critical infrastructure secrets? Especially curious about backup encryption strategies and whether anyone else uses mathematical secret sharing for this.\n\n**Full disclosure:** We built this after almost losing backup access during a team transition at our company.

First semester senior year i hit rock bottom, ended up leaving the shcool and switched into an online program called ICT, i.t. with communications.  Over the last 3 semester i have finished the degree and have landed a linux engineer job making 87,500 a year, crazy i know, truly blessed I got it off connections.  Now i am in a position where I need to stick with something and lock in.  I can either stick with the linux enginner job and keeping pushing into the tech field, start taking accounting classes on the side (accounting still intrigues me due to the fact that once you learn it you know it the constant learning in i.t. kills me), or go into tech sales my communication skills are great and i think could do really well.  However, with all that being said my main goal in life is to be an entrepreneur. I know I'm only 22 about to be 23 and have my whole life ahead but i want to make a decision.  I can do any route.  \n\nQuestions: (After reading what I typed out I should definitely stick with the linux engineer gig and keep pushing the only way to get genuilly rich off accounting is partner at a big 4 or starting your own firm and that's like a 10-15 year journey.  Money isn't everything I know but why not want to be rich?)\n\nDo you guys enjoy it?\n\nDo you feel confident in your day to day life being a sysadmin/engineer?\n\nBased off what I said should I start making moves onto another path?\n\nShould I just lock in on this career path and try my own start up/designing apps\n\nMy end goal in life is a family i just want the best woman possible.",

Currently working in both SAN (Dell, HPE) and NAS (NetApp) environments. Recently I am doing storage file system (FSxN) builds and migrations from on-prem to AWS cloud.

AZ-104\nAnd few entry level certs for Terraform and Kubernetes \n\nBut, I am thinking of getting a basic linux certification to understand linux.

    "body": "I have approx 120 Alma servers that I manage patching for. I use Foreman to manage software versions, and Ansible via AWX to perform the updates.\n\nA simplified version of my Patching Lifecycles and Batches are as follows:\n\n`Canaries`  \n`- (Two stand alone canary boxes)`\n\n`PreProd Day 1 (Internal team test boxes)`  \n`- (Four 2 node pairs (nginx, postfix.haproxy)`  \n`- (Two 3 node clusters redis, rmq)`\n\n`PreProd Day 2 (dev and other stakeholder facing boxes)`  \n`- (small number of stand alones)`  \n`- (Eight 2 node pairs (nginx, postfix, haproxy)`  \n`- (Six 3 node clusters redis, rmq)`  \n`- (One 3 node mysql cluster - QA)`\n\n`PreProd Day 3`  \n`- (One 3 node mysql cluster - STG)`\n\n`Prod Day 1`  \n`- (small number of stand alones)`  \n`- (Eight 2 node pairs (nginx, postfix.haproxy)`  \n`- (Four node clusters redis, rmq)`\n\n`Prod Day 2`  \n`- (One 3 node mysql cluster)`\n\nSo for example one batch would consist of 3 individual playbooks runs like the following to ensure only one node from each cluster is patched at any one time:\n\n`rmq01 cust1red01 cust2red03 cust3red02`  \n`rmq02 cust1red02 cust2red01 cust3red03`  \n`rmq03 cust1red03 cust2red02 cust3red01`\n\nI tried using host groups within AWX to organise the boxes into separate groups of lifecycles and major OS versions previously, but I was doing this manually at the rime and found the process at the time quite fiddly and prone to human error, so for patching I started maintaining a text list of batches which I'd update and process manually.\n\nThe estate has grown however and this manual process is becoming unwieldy, so I want to take another look.\n\nI could run everything in serial but I like to keep eyes on the patching process for any failures, and I felt like if I just left it to chug away in the background I'd potentially get distracted (we had until recently had an older version of AWX that didn't support e-mail notifications, although I want to get this, and hopefully webhook notifications to Teams configured on the new AWX24 box I'm currently building to flag any failed playbooks/updates.\n\nSo my question is can anybody offer any advise on how should I organise these hosts in terms of lifecycle, patching day and batches within Ansible?\n\nMy current thoughts are perhaps a group hierarchy such as the following, and potentially set a variable for the sequence/patching order within the patch. Or I could make greater use of running the patching playbooks in serial.\n\n`canaries`  \n`preprod-day1`  \n`- batch 1`  \n`- batch 2`  \n`- batch 3`  \n`prod`  \n`-batch 1`  \n`- batch 2`\n\nAnother possible option might be to incorporate using hostname conventions (all our boxes have a 3 character role identifier such as \"hap or \"red\", by a 2 digit numerical value), although dynamically calculating batch order might prove fiddly given that some services are in clusters of 2 and some are in clusters of 3.\n\nI also want to automate organisation of the group and any related vars during deployment so that maintaining the batches is no longer a manual process..At present hosts are automatically added to a single \"Alma\" Inventory using the awx.awx module at time of deployment - Ideally I don't want to subdivide the hosts into separate Inventories as there are times I need to run a grep or other search across the entire estate in one go, but I'd consider it if there was sufficient benefit).\n\nCan anybody offer any advice on how to best go about organising my infrastructure/any other tips for automating my patching schedule?\n\nMany thanks.",

    "body": "How can this be said without the words coming out as overly dramatic? The best computer monitors for gaming provide a portal into a virtual realm. They recreate millions of colors in vibrant detail, immerse you in epic battles, pitch you in combat against low-latency monsters and realistic enemy troops. In an ideal world, all displays would render these worlds perfectly, without screen tearing or ghosting. The anti-aliased foreground would flow like liquid, the background scroll seamlessly, not a scrap of a glitch to be found. However, we don’t live in an ideal world.\n\nReal gaming monitors are workhorse devices. They’re expected to create an immersive display capable of sucking you into the action. To keep this illusion intact, low-latency HD or 4K graphics transform high GPU frame rates into millions of pixels, throwing these colored dots around the screen without breaking a digital sweat. So, just to count off the main features on one hand, flagship gaming panels have low latencies, ultra-high resolutions, superior color depths, and fast response times. We’ll reserve the other hand for counting off a few not-so-popular features. Onwards and upwards, then.\n\n**Our Best Monitors for Gaming – Latest Recommendations**\n\n* [LG UltraGear OLED WQHD 34” Curved Gaming Monitor](https://astonmet.com/monitors-for-gaming/#LG_UltraGear_OLED_WQHD_34%E2%80%9D_Curved_Gaming_Monitor)\n* [Samsung Odyssey Neo G7 32” Curved Gaming Monitor](https://astonmet.com/monitors-for-gaming/#Samsung_Odyssey_Neo_G7_32%E2%80%9D_Curved_Gaming_Monitor)\n* [Dell Alienware QD-OLED 32” AW3225QF Gaming Monitor](https://astonmet.com/monitors-for-gaming/#Dell_Alienware_QD-OLED_32%E2%80%9D_AW3225QF_Gaming_Monitor)\n* [BenQ Mobiuz EX480UZ 48” Gaming Monitor](https://astonmet.com/monitors-for-gaming/#BenQ_Mobiuz_EX480UZ_48%E2%80%9D_Gaming_Monitor)\n* [MSI MPG 321 URX QD-OLED Gaming Monitor](https://astonmet.com/monitors-for-gaming/#MSI_MPG_321_URX_QD-OLED_Gaming_Monitor)\n* [Asus ROG Swift 39” OLED PG39WCDM Gaming Monitor](https://astonmet.com/monitors-for-gaming/#Asus_ROG_Swift_39%E2%80%9D_OLED_PG39WCDM_Gaming_Monitor)\n* [HP Omen 27k 144Hz Gaming Monitor](https://astonmet.com/monitors-for-gaming/#HP_Omen_27k_144Hz_Gaming_Monitor)\n* [Gigabyte G34WQC 34” Gaming Monitor](https://astonmet.com/monitors-for-gaming/#Gigabyte_G34WQC_34%E2%80%9D_Gaming_Monitor)\n\n**Level Up Your Gaming Monitor**\n\nUltrawide curved screens make for some of the best computer monitors for gaming. Still, with the amount of curve varying from one product to the next, it might be a good idea to hit up your local big box store and see which model feels immersive and which creates feelings of claustrophobia. The 1500R Gigabyte G34WQC was heavily favored when delving into lush virtual environments. The Dell Alienware AW3225QF had an even subtler sweep, so either of these panels would be outstanding visual companions in large worlds where cinematic quests are encountered.\n\nA smaller radius, perhaps as seen on the 1000R Samsung Odyssey Neo G7, might be a good place to start when shopping. It hits that perfect sweet spot, balancing performance against game immersion. Moving on, features like G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium are desirable, reducing screen tear and display lag, but you should check the specs on your GPU before buying a monitor that supports one or both of these technologies. Radeon and nVidia graphics cards need specific drivers and hardware technologies, so match accordingly.\n\nWith all that being said, try to prioritize visual richness over flashy features. Buy with image crispness, vibrancy and low latency displays firmly in mind. Choose monitors that have clutter saving ports and GPU maximizing sync features. And yes, do be swayed by the flat or ultrawide curves on these screens, knowing that these are the final link in your gaming rig, but know that it’s all about what enhances your gaming experience, not just what looks cool. Superior hardware over thinner bezels, that’s what you’re shopping for. Although, if you can have both, more power to you.\n\nNo matter your GPU and CPU, SSD and RAM configurations, it’s all for nothing without a premium gaming monitor. Go for size and color depth, pixel crispness and motion fluidity, maybe even RGB ambient rear lighting, too. Above all else, opt for one of the best brands, as promoted in this review of best computer monitors for gaming. As a final endnote, don’t forget to ask about product warranty terms.

    "body": "Hi, \n\nas the title, it is considered obsolete? I'm asking because many uses modern filesystem like ZFS and BTRFS and tag mdadm raid as obsolete thing.\n\nFor example on RHEL/derivatives there is not support for ZFS (except from third party) and BTRFS (except from third party) and the only ways to create a RAID is mdadm, LVM (that uses MD) or hardware RAID. Actually EL9.5 cannot build ZFS module and BTRFS is supported by ELREPO with a different kernel from the base. On other distro like Debian and Ubuntu, there are not such problems. ZFS is supported on theme: on Debian via DKMS and works very well, plus, if I'm not wrong Debian has a ZFS dedicated team while on Ubuntu LTS is officially supported by the distro. Without speaking of BTRFS that is ready out of the box for these 2 distro. \n\nWell, mdadm is considered obsolete? If yes what can replace it?\n\nAre you using mdadm on production machines actually or you are dismissing it?\n\nThank you in advance  \n",

    "body": "A month ago, I [launched Open Archiver](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/1mo6869/i_built_an_opensource_email_archiving_tool_with/) here at [r/linuxadmin](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/), and it has received significant support from the community. Now we have reached more than 600 stars on GitHub and have 6 community controbutors. Thank you all for your support!\n\nToday I'd like to announce version 0.3 of Open Archiver, which has added the following key features based on your feedback:\n\n* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** This is the most requested feature and we made it a reality. You can now create multiple users with specific roles. We also implemented an AWS IAM-style policy system so you can get granular with permissions for different resources.\n* **User API Key Support:** For everyone wanting to automate or integrate, users can now generate and manage their own API keys. This allows you to access resources programmatically.\n* **Multi-language Support &amp; System Settings:** The interface (and even the API!) now supports multiple languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Japanese, Italian, and of course, Estonian, since we're based here in 🇪🇪!).\n\nFor folks who don't know what Open Archiver is, it is an open-source tool that helps individuals and organizations to archive their whole email inboxes with the ability to index and search these emails. It has the ability to archive emails from cloud-based email inboxes, including Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, and all IMAP-enabled email inboxes. You can connect it to your email provider, and it copies every single incoming and outgoing email into a secure archive that you control (Your local storage or S3-compatible storage).\n\nHere are some of the main features:\n\n* **Comprehensive archiving:** It doesn't just import emails; it indexes the full content of both the messages and common attachments.\n* **Organization-Wide backup:** It handles multi-user environments, so you can connect it to your Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 tenant and **back up every user's mailbox**.\n* **Powerful full-text search:** There's a clean web UI with a high-performance search engine, letting you dig through the entire archive (messages and attachments included) quickly.\n* **You control the storage:** You have full control over where your data is stored. The storage backend is pluggable, supporting your local filesystem or S3-compatible object storage right out of the box.\n\nCheck out our GitHub repo for more information: [https://github.com/LogicLabs-OU/OpenArchiver](https://github.com/LogicLabs-OU/OpenArchiver)\n\nCheers and thanks again for your support!",

    "body": "Hey all,\n\nI’m a service desk analyst just moving into my second year in IT. I love what I do—this is a second career for me after 20 years in another industry—and I’m really grateful to have found something that clicks. My current role is all Windows, and while I’m learning a lot and see the value in mastering that stack, I’ve had a growing passion for Linux for the last few years.\n\nEven though we don’t touch Linux day-to-day in my current role, we’re a partner organization with Red Hat, so I actually have access to the official training material, and the RHCSA exam is reimbursed if I pass. It feels like a golden opportunity to dive into something I care about without the usual cost barriers. We’re a big enough company that there are Linux-focused roles internally—they’re just a lot fewer and farther between compared to Windows-based sysadmin or engineering positions.\n\nThat’s where my dilemma comes in. I’m in my 40s now with a young family and very limited time for study. If I go down the Linux/RHCSA path, I know it’s not going to be something I can knock out in a few months. It’s probably going to take me a year or more to get through it at my pace. And even then, there’s no guarantee that it will directly benefit my current role or next move—at least not immediately.\n\nThe logical option might be to just lean further into Windows. Stick with the environment I’m in, look at certs like MS-102 or AZ-104, and build a faster path forward internally. That makes sense on paper, especially with how time poor I am right now.\n\nBut the thing is… Linux really resonates with me. The hands-on approach of the RHCSA, the \"learn it from the ground up\" philosophy, and the community around it—it just feels right. I’m someone who enjoys knowing how things actually work under the hood, and Linux scratches that itch in a way Windows never quite has. I also know that over the next 5, 10, 15+ years, I want my day job to be something I find stimulating and rewarding—not just something I’m good at.\n\nMaybe Linux can just stay a hobby for now. But part of me feels like if I don’t invest in it seriously, it’ll always stay on the back burner. And if I do invest, even slowly, I could build a foundation that sets me up for a shift down the line—maybe into sysadmin, cloud, or even DevOps.\n\nWould really appreciate any thoughts from folks who’ve had to choose between playing it safe with what’s in front of them vs. pursuing something they’re more passionate about that might take longer to pay off. Especially if you’re later in your career or balancing study with a busy life.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

    "body": "Hello,\n\nI'm trying to replicate a couple of KVM virtual machines from a site to a disaster recovery site over WAN links.  \nAs of today the VMs are stored as qcow2 images on a mdadm RAID with xfs. The KVM hosts and VMs are my personal ones (still it's not a lab, as I serve my own email servers and production systems, as well as a couple of friends VMs).\n\nMy goal is to have VM replicas ready to run on my secondary KVM host, which should have a maximum interval of 1H between their state and the original VM state.\n\nSo far, there are commercial solutions (DRBD + DRBD Proxy and a few others) that allow duplicating the underlying storage in async mode over a WAN link, but they aren't exactly cheap (DRBD Proxy isn't open source, neither free).\n\nThe costs in my project should stay reasonable (I'm not spending 5 grands every year for this, nor am I allowing a yearly license that stops working if I don't pay support !). Don't get me wrong, I am willing to spend some money for that project, just not a yearly budget of that magnitude.\n\nSo I'm kind of seeking the \"poor man's\" alternative (or a great open source project) to replicate my VMs:\n\nSo far, I thought of file system replication:\n\n\\- LizardFS: promise WAN replication, but project seems dead\n\n\\- SaunaFS: LizardFS fork, they don't plan WAN replication yet, but they seem to be cool guys\n\n\\- GlusterFS: Deprecrated, so that's a nogo\n\nI didn't find any FS that could fulfill my dreams, so I thought about snapshot shipping solutions:\n\n\\- ZFS + send/receive: Great solution, except that COW performance is not that good for VM workloads (proxmox guys would say otherwise), and sometimes kernel updates break zfs and I need to manually fix dkms or downgrade to enjoy zfs again\n\n\\- XFS dump / receive: Looks like a great solution too, with less snapshot possibilities (9 levels of incremental snapshots are possible at best)\n\n\\- LVM + XFS snapshots + rsync: File system agnostic solution, but I fear that rsync would need to read all data on the source and the destination for comparisons, making the solution painfully slow\n\n\\- qcow2 disk snapshots + restic backup: File system agonstic solution, but image restoration would take some time on the replica side\n\nI'm pretty sure I didn't think enough about this. There must be some people who achieved VM geo-replication without any guru powers nor infinite corporate money.\n\nAny advices would be great, especially proven solutions of course ;)\n\nThank you.",

I have Linux experience, but the nature of my work &amp; learning history have only required that I learn it not just good, but good enough. Then there's months where I won't work with that OS, which requires a small re-learn time to reacquaint myself with it. \n\nWhat are your go-to learning resources for Ansible and building architectures? Will likely be RHEL. \n\nUPDATE: Interview happened on 7/22/2025 and it went. . . surprisingly well! I was told the nature of the work is such that no one would be 100% qualified. They're looking for someone with a technical background, understands how network traffic works, and has the ability to adapt to changing circumstances (work is at a national laboratory). I have all those things. It didn't go unnoticed that I'm an InfoSec person, and they asked why I was interested in this one. I was honest &amp; explained that 1) building an infrastructure sounds wicked cool &amp; 2) I have an interview with the cyber team next week. Turns out that cyber position was created specifically for working with this team, it just happens to be funded by a different department. This position was open because three of their current team is set to retire within the next 3 years and they need to start building a replacement team.\n\nBefore the interview, I was talking with other colleagues and learned that most Linux admins in the area are paid exceedingly well. To the point were a national lab couldn't afford them. I'm told six figures and the 1st digit is &gt; 1. Therefore, for what they're looking to provide for compensation, my skill set could be a nice fit. \n\nI know they've been interviewing for 2 weeks prior to my appointment, so I wouldn't be surprised if they already have their ideal candidate. But it was a nice experience. Thank you for your pointers, they were very helpful. ",

Looking at the KCNA for a start, or maybe jumping to the CKAD or CKA. Kubernetes is huge right now, feels like you need to know it. Which one of those Kube certs gives the most benefit for what I'm looking for? CKA for managing, CKAD for building, it's a bit confusing.\nTrying to figure out if it's better to go with the deep Linux knowledge from Red Hat or jump fully into Kubernetes, which seems like the future.\nAnyone got experience with these?

See response to u/lighthawk16 for the full details!  His post about got me checking more things, so kudos to him!  It was a fun puzzle!\n\nSo I was going through my Ubuntu servers VMs today bringing them up to current.  Two were really old (18.04) and so I had 2 do-release-upgrade cycles.  On the second one to 22.04, no boot.  Just hangs...  If I look back in the logs is seems to fail mounting vda1.  But...  If I boot to the rescue console, and then resume normal boot, it comes up fine!  WTF?\n\nNow these are not critical servers, and I can take time to look into it.  And it is an interesting puzzle!  The fact that 2 out of 20 VMs are failing the exact same way is just odd!  And I checked the configs and even manually upgraded the machine type to 'pc' in case that was causing it.  Also rebuilt initramfs and updated grub.  Nothing works but the manual rescue console boot.  I do suspect it is something in the machine config as it also had trouble booting Ubuntu 22.04 live desktop.

    "body": "Good morning,\n\n  \nI am in the process of creating a updated Mailman list serv that will host lists and archives that are currently on an outdated Mailman server hosted on an unsupported Solaris Server.\n\nBackground\n\nIn my organization's environment there is  Mailman list serv  running 2.1.14.   It is being hosted on a 15 year old  Sun Microsystems Solaris sever.  It has not been updated and cannot be patched due to the End of Life support.   My team is trying to pull everything off the server so we can decomission it.  I have already set up a Mailman3 email sever in an Oracle Linux test environment.  Yesterday I had assigned it a static ip address, default gateway, and dns ip provided by our networking team.  I had given it a hostname that is similar to the hostname of the old list serv on the Sun server and doing so caused the old list serv to hang.  So I had to change my hostname in the test Mailman server then shutdown the VM.  Afterward,  my co-worker changed the DNS address on the old list serv and then had my other coworker and I reboot the Sun server.\n\n\n\nCurrent Situation\n\nLooking to power my VM back on, it has been disconnected from my network.  Then ensure my hostname does not contain any words from the hostname on the old list serv .  Then get the VM back online.  I spoke with my coworker and our datacenter supervisor and they said the way to migrate the lists and archive off the  Sun server is to copy everything over to the new Mailman list server, run some tests to make sure email works, and then point the domain name on the old Mailman to the new one and then turn the old server off.   I will be discussing this with my team soon.\n\n  \nDoes anyboday have experience working with Mailman list servs on the backend? Has anyone done a similar migration? Am I approaching this the right way?\n\n  \nThank you",

    "title": "PSA: You can add full-disk encryption to any TerraMaster NAS with SSH access. Here's what I learned the hard way.",
    "body": "TIL that TerraMaster's TOS can't see through LUKS encryption layers, which means my perfectly working encrypted RAID array is invisible to the WebUI - but maybe that's not actually a problem?\n\nI'm new to TerraMaster hardware and was surprised to find they don't offer encryption by default in TOS 5.x. But having root SSH access means you can implement it yourself - though only on clean drives (or with some serious volume juggling if you have existing data).\n\n**What I did:** Set up full-disk LUKS encryption with this stack:\n\n    Physical drives (sda4/sdb4)\n        ↓\n    LUKS encryption (AES-256-XTS)\n        ↓\n    RAID 1 (mdadm)\n        ↓\n    LVM (Volume Group + Logical Volume)\n        ↓\n    Btrfs filesystem\n\nEverything works perfectly via CLI - encryption is solid, RAID is mirroring, I can mount/unmount, create snapshots, everything. Performance is great too thanks to AES-NI hardware acceleration.\n\n**The catch:** TOS WebUI can't see the volume. It shows the Storage Pool exists (7.27TB RAID 1) but says \"No valid data\" for the actual volume.\n\n**What I tried to make TOS recognize it:**\n\n* Renamed VG/LV to match TOS naming conventions (UTOSCORE-X86-S64/UTOSVOL-X86-S64)\n* Added all the proper LVM tags (UTOSPOOL=1, UTOSVOL=1)\n* Verified the entire stack matches how TOS structures volumes internally\n\nTurns out TOS's disk detection tool (`ter_disklib_cli`) can't see through the LUKS layer. It tries to read disk labels from `/dev/md0`, but since the RAID is built on encrypted mappers instead of raw partitions, it just sees encrypted data.\n\n**My main question:** Am I losing anything significant with this setup? I can't manage the volume through WebUI, but everything works via SSH. Mount it at `/mnt/MD0` and all TOS apps (SMB, Docker, etc.) work fine. If anyone has ideas how to make it work 100% with the WebUI, that would be amazing.\n\nAlso, does TOS 6 even have encryption? I don't see it coming to the F2-423 anytime soon, and it's disappointing that a modern NAS OS doesn't have encryption out of the box in 2025.\n\nI didn't want to jump straight to TrueNAS because I wanted to give TOS a shot and keep it more spouse-friendly. The irony is that now I'm managing everything through SSH anyway!\n\n**TL;DR:** LUKS encryption works perfectly on TerraMaster, but TOS WebUI can't see encrypted volumes. Feature or bug? You decide.",

    "body": "Hello Guys, I recently applied for a linux system admin in my company. I received a task, and I failed on the task. I need help understanding the “Load Averages”\n\nTotal CPU usage is 87.7% \nLoad Average is 37.66, 36.58, 32.71\nTotal Amount of RAM - 84397220k (84.39 GB)\nAmount or RAM used - 80527840k (80.52 GB)\nFree RAM - 3869380k (3.86 GB)\nServer up and running for 182 days &amp; 22 hours 49 minutes\n\nI Googled a lot and also used these articles for the task:\n\nhttps://phoenixnap.com/kb/linux-average-load \n\nhttps://www.site24x7.com/blog/load-average-what-is-it-and-whats-the-best-load-average-for-your-linux-servers\n\nThis is what, I have provided on the task:\n\nThe CPU warning caused by the High Load Average, High CPU usage and High RAM usage. For a 24 threaded CPU, the load average can be up to 24. However, the load average is 37.66 in one minute, 36.58 in five minutes, 32.71 in fifteen minutes. This means that the CPU is overloaded. There is a high chance that the server might crash or become unresponsive. \n\nAvailable physical RAM is very low, which forces the server to use the SWAP memory. Since the SWAP memory uses hard disk space and it will be slow, it is best to fix the high RAM usage by optimizing the application running on the server or by adding more RAM. \n\n\tThe “wa” in the CPU(s) is 36.7% which means that the CPU is being idle for the input/output operations to be completed. This means that there is a high I/O load. The “wa”  is the percent of wait time (if high, CPU is waiting for I/O access).\n \n\n\n————\n\nFeedback from the interviewer:\n\nCorrectly described individual details but was unable to connect them into coherent cause and effect picture.\n\n\nUnable to provide accurate recommendation for normalising the server status.\n\n\n—————\n\n \nI am new to Linux and I was sure that I cannot clear the interview. I wanted to check the interview process so applied for it. I planned on applying for the position again in 6-8 months. \n\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. How do you fix the Load averages.\n2. Are there any websites, I can use to learn more about load averages.\n3. How do you approach this task? \n\n\nAny tips or suggestions would mean a lot, thanks in advance :)\n\n\n\n\n",

Which absolutely will hurt the company a lot.\n\nThe main issue we have, we have lot's of developers. Currently all have to use Ubuntu. Some are absolutely fine on their own with the Laptop and the System itself. \n\nBut we do have some, which certainly cannot be trusted with any admin access to their machine. So many aren't even able to use their Headphones correctly and are then trying to google solutions for User Errors and accidentally uninstall their desktop environment.\nCurrently all need some kind of root access to install packages and so on.\n\nCurrently we use Landscape and Microsoft Defender for some stuff, but it's just not very usable. And especially as we are looking into switching to another environment, currently looking at Fedora as we are using Servers with RedHat based systems which would also allow us to not built any software solution 3 times for different systems and just 2.\n\nI need to find a management solution which will:\n- Push Force Updates to the Users that don't like Updating their system\n- Install Packages on Request of the Users from a centralized Website \n- Includes a CVE Database\n- Possible to be operated by Service Desk IT People who are completely incompetent and don't want to learn anything\n\nI know these aren't the highest of requirements still these are causing lot of pain and causing a high overload of work for so many people of our team. Especially since the Service Desk is incompetent. Anyone knows a good solution?\nWhich I could use to talk with our supervisors?",

One of the first tasks I was assigned when I joined was to implement a new policy that prohibits the use of the root user across the organization.\n\nWe already had Puppet deployed, so I decided to leverage the `saz-sudo` module to enforce this policy. Using it, I’ve been allowing specific commands for users and dividing permissions based on groups, essentially “whitelisting” what users are allowed to do without needing root access.\n\nThe setup works, but I’m not 100% confident it is the right or best practice. It also hasn’t been easy to apply this consistently across the whole organization.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n* Does this approach make sense to you?\n* How do other organizations implement rootless environments at scale?\n* Are there better practices/tools I should consider?\n\nWould really appreciate any insights or experiences you can share!\n\nThanks guys!",

    "body": "I work at a small EDA company; the usual work model is users share a login server that is intended primarily for VNC, editing files, etc.. but occasionally gets used for viewing waves or other CPU and memory intensive processes (most of these are pushed off to the compute farm, but for reasons some users want or need to work locally).\n\nMost of our login servers are 64-core Epyc 9354, 500GB memory or 1.5TB memory, 250GB swap. Swappiness is set to 10. We might have 10-20 users on a server. The servers are running Centos7 (yes, old, but there are valid reasons why we are on this version)\n\nOccasionally a user process or two will go haywire and consume the memory. I have `earlyoom` installed but, for reasons I'm still trying to debug, it sometimes can't kill the processes. For example see the `journalctl` snippet below. When this happens the machine becomes effectively unresponsive for many hours before either recovering or crashing.\n\nMy questions -- In this kind of environment:\n\n* Should we have swap configured at all? Or just no swap?\n* If swap, what should we have swappiness set to?\n\nMy assumption here is that the machine isn't being aggressive enough about pushing data out to swap, so memory fills but earlyoom doesn't kick in quickly because there's still plenty of swap. That seems like it could be addressed either with having no swap, or making swap more aggressive.

The `/var/log/tcpdumpd` directory has context type with `var_log_t` but SELinux is blocking tcpdump from saving captures to that directory through a systemd service. I use a systemd service to automate tcpdump captures whenever the system boots. When I try starting the tcpdump systemd service in enforcing mode using `systemctl start my-tcpdumpd.service`, the service doesn't start and just returns an error saying `Couldn't change ownership of savefile`. The service only works when SELinux is set to permissive mode.\n\nI made sure the `/var/log/tcpdumpd/` directory is owned by root with chmod numerical value being 755, but it still doesn't work. I can't use `semanage fcontext` to change the context type for `/var/log/tcpdumpd/` because I already ensured the `/var/log/tcpdumpd/` directory has a context type of `var_log_t` by doing `ls -lZ /var/log/`.\n\nI tried creating a custom SELinux policy by doing `ausearch -m AVC -c tcpdump --raw | audit2allow -M my_tcpdump_policy` as root, and it generated the two files, such as `my_tcpdump_policy.pp` and `my_tcpdump_policy.te`. I'm more curious about the TE file because it may allow creating a custom SELinux policy that can actually allow tcpdump to write captures to a directory with `var_log_t` label like `/var/log/tcpdumpd/`. What should the TE file look like exactly, so that I can get a working SELinux policy and also get a `pcap_data_t` label I can assign to the `/var/log/tcpdumpd/` directory?\nHere's what my script looks like currently:\n```\nmodule my_tcpdump_policy 1.0;\n\nrequire {\n        type netutils_t:\n        class capability dac_override:\n}\n.\n#============= netutils_t ==============\nallow netutils_t self:capability dac_override;\n```\n\nAny help is appreciated!",

    "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m not a real sysadmin or anything. I’ve just always been the “computer guy” in my grad lab and at a couple jobs. We’ve got a few shared machines that everyone uses, and it’s a constant problem where someone runs a big job, eats all the RAM or CPU, and the whole thing crashes for everyone else.\n\nI tried using systemdspawner with JupyterHub for a while, and it actually worked really well. Users had to sign out a set amount of resources and were limited by systemd. The problem was that people figured out they could just SSH into the server and bypass all the limits.\n\nI looked into schedulers like SLURM, but that felt like overkill for what I needed. What I really wanted was basically systemdspawner, but for everything a user does on the system, not just Jupyter sessions.\n\nSo I ended up building something called fairshare. The idea was simple: the admin sets a default (like 1 CPU and 2 GB RAM per user), and users can check how many resources are available and request more. Systemd enforces the limits automatically so people can’t hog everything.\n\nNot sure if this is something others would find useful, but it’s been great for me so far. Just figured I’d share in case anyone else is dealing with the same shared server headaches.\n\nhttps://github.com/WilliamJudge94/fairshare/tree/main",

Can anyone offer additions or changes that should be made given the age of the comment? \n\nThanks!\n\n\nEDIT, to save the click I'm quoting the linked comment below. Once again, all credit is to u/IConrad:\n\n&gt; This is what I tell people to do, who ask me \"how do I learn to be a Linux sysadmin?\".\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Set up a KVM hypervisor.  \n&gt; 2) Inside of that KVM hypervisor, install a Spacewalk server. Use CentOS 6 as the distro for all work below. (For bonus points, set up errata importation on the CentOS channels, so you can properly see security update advisory information.)      \n&gt; 3) Create a VM to provide named and dhcpd service to your entire environment. Set up the dhcp daemon to use the Spacewalk server as the pxeboot machine (thus allowing you to use Cobbler to do unattended OS installs).  Make sure that every forward zone you create has a reverse zone associated with it. Use something like \"internal.virtnet\" (but *not* \".local\") as your internal DNS zone.  \n&gt; 4) Use that Spacewalk server to automatically (without touching it) install a new pair of OS instances, with which you will then create a Master/Master pair of LDAP servers.  Make sure they register with the Spacewalk server. Do *not* allow anonymous bind, do *not* use unencrypted LDAP.  \n&gt; 5) Reconfigure all 3 servers to use LDAP authentication.    \n&gt; 6) Create two new VMs, again unattendedly, which will then be Postgresql VMs. Use pgpool-II to set up master/master replication between them.  Export the database from your Spacewalk server and import it into the new pgsql cluster.  Reconfigure your Spacewalk instance to run off of that server.    \n&gt; 7) Set up a Puppet Master.  Plug it into the Spacewalk server for identifying the inventory it will need to work with.  (Cheat and use ansible for deployment purposes, again plugging into the Spacewalk server.)    \n&gt; 8) Deploy another VM. Install iscsitgt and nfs-kernel-server on it. Export a LUN and an NFS share.  \n&gt; 9) Deploy another VM. Install bakula on it, using the postgresql cluster to store its database.  Register each machine on it, storing to flatfile. Store the bakula VM's image on the iscsi LUN, and every other machine on the NFS share.  \n&gt; 10) Deploy two more VMs. These will have httpd (Apache2) on them. Leave essentially default for now.  \n&gt; 11) Deploy two *more* VMs. These will have tomcat on them. Use JBoss Cache to replicate the session caches between them. Use the httpd servers as the frontends for this.  The application you will run is [JBoss Wiki](http://jbosswiki.jboss.org/).  \n&gt; 12) You guessed right, deploy another VM. This will do iptables-based NAT/round-robin loadbalancing between the two httpd servers.   \n&gt; 13) Deploy another VM.  On this VM, install postfix. Set it up to use a gmail account to allow you to have it send emails, and receive messages only from your internal network.  \n&gt; 14) Deploy another VM.  On this VM, set up a Nagios server. Have it use snmp to monitor the communication state of every relevant service involved above. This means doing a \"is the right port open\" check, *and* a \"I got the right kind of response\" check *and* \"We still have filesystem space free\" check.  \n&gt; 15) Deploy another VM.  On this VM, set up a syslog daemon to listen to every other server's input. Reconfigure each other server to send their logging output to various files *on the syslog server*.  (For extra credit, set up logstash or kibana or greylog to parse those logs.)  \n&gt; 16) Document every last step you did in getting to this point in your brand new Wiki.  \n&gt; 17) Now go back and create Puppet Manifests to ensure that every last one of these machines is authenticating to the LDAP servers, registered to the Spacewalk server, and backed up by the bakula server.  \n&gt; 18) Now go back, reference your documents, and set up a Puppet Razor profile that hooks into each of these things to allow you to recreate, from scratch, each individual server.  \n&gt; 19) Destroy every secondary machine you've created and use the above profile to recreate them, joining them to the clusters as needed.  \n&gt; 20) Bonus exercise: create three more VMs. A CentOS 5, 6, and 7 machine.  On *each* of these machines, set them up to allow you to create custom RPMs and import them into the Spacewalk server instance. Ensure your Puppet configurations work for all three and produce like-for-like behaviors.\n&gt; \n&gt; Do these things and you will be fully exposed to every aspect of Linux Enterprise systems administration.  Do them well and you will have the *technical* expertise required to seek \"Senior\" roles.  If you go whole-hog crash-course full-time it with no other means of income, I would expect it would take between 3 and 6 months to go from \"I think I'm good with computers\" to achieving all of these -- assuming you're not afraid of IRC and google (and have neither friends nor family ...).",

Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away *permanently*  unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't  able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through  the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what  we do because *we love Reddit*, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.\n\nThe two-day blackout isn't the *goal*,  and it isn't the end.

Please make every  effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as  possible. **This includes not harassing moderators of subreddits who have chosen not to take part**: no one likes a missionary, a used-car salesman, or a flame warrior.",

You can even describe your run time in plain English, i.e. \"next Sunday\".\n\nTo run one script at a later time, this is all you need to do:\n\n```\n[root@localhost #] at 6:00 AM Sun\nat&gt; /path/to/maintenance_script.sh\n&lt;Ctrl+D&gt; \n```\n\nYou can even make it a one-liner using an echo and a pipe:\n\n```\necho \"/path/to/maintenance_script.sh\" | at now + 6 hours\n```\n\nIf you are in some custom distro that  does not provide the *at* command, then take the time to add logic in your script that keeps it from running again: touch a .done file, snipe the line out of your crontab at the end, etc.\n\nI had to deal with an outage yesterday, because an admin had left some service shutdown commands in the crontab from a previous weekend maintenance.

    "title": "\"how do I learn to be a Linux sysadmin?\" comprehensive task list 2.0",
    "body": "Came across [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/h16i0j/how_do_i_learn_to_be_a_linux_sysadmin/) (made by [u/IConrad](https://www.reddit.com/u/IConrad/) reposted by [u/Thinkk](https://www.reddit.com/user/Thinkk/) ) and tried my hand at it but Spacewalk has been discontinued, as is CentOS 6. Absolute minimum requirements: 64 GB of RAM and 32 GB storage per host (can grow) with 20 VMs (with a few exception from those that process data), give or take (will take suggestions to make it lighter).\n\nThis is what I tell people to do, who ask me \"how do I learn to be a Linux sysadmin?\".\n\n1. Set up a hypervisor of your choice (for example KVM)\n2. Create two VMs on the Hypervisor, these will be used for hosting freeIPA as authentication services for your environment. Remember to set them up with static IP addresses.\n3. Create another VM on that hypervisor and install Foreman+Katello on that server. Also set that host up with a static IP address.\n4. Configure the foreman host according to your environment meaning\n\n* create organizations in foreman\n* create locations in foreman\n* create compute resources that foreman should deploy your VMs to\n\n\\- create compute profiles for your VMs\n\n\\- create domains to associate to your hosts\n\n\\- create environments for puppet (deprecated)\n\n\\- create realms that foreman should enroll your hosts to\n\n\\- update settings that you want to adjust\n\n\\- create subnets that hosts can be provisioned to\n\n\\- create content credentials allowing to be associated with repos\n\n\\- create products that will contain sets of software repositories\n\n\\- create repositories for the products you created\n\n\\- create lifecycle environment(s) to manage content rollouts to your hosts\n\n\\- create content views that will contain the required products and repositories\n\n\\- create activation keys so that hosts can be automatically subscribed to content\n\n\\- create installation media to pxeboot vms that will be provisioned by foreman\n\n\\- create operatingsystem definitions (will be utilized in the provisioning process)\n\n\\- create hostgroups that combine predefined settings\n\n5. Assuming you've done all of #4, register your freeIPA hosts to the foreman server.\n\nMake sure they are getting repo information as expected.\n\n6. Set up a dhcp-server which will hand out PXE instructions for your environment. This one can be hosted on your foreman server, IPA server or on a separate VM you create manually again.\n\n7. From here on out, you should be able to provision your first VM unattended. Install Ansible on this host and leave any configuration aside for now.\n\n8. Provision another VM using foreman. Give this one an extra disk and make it an ISCSI target and install NFS server on it. Use the second disk for nothing OS related, only for NFS and ISCSI storage\n\n9. Provision another VM. This one will handle email for your environment. Use whatever you see fit for a setup. Here are some options:\n\n\\- zimbra\n\n\\- iredmail\n\n\\- mailinabox\n\n\\- mailcow\n\n\\- postfix+dovecot+roundcube\n\n10. Reconfigure all VMs to use that email server you just provisioned for sending mails.\n\n11. Provision 3 more servers, setup a kubernetes cluster on them. Integrate metallb, nginx-ingress and metrics-server.\n\n12. Provision another VM. This host will be your internal registry for containers you build yourself. You can use the community edition of nexus or the default docker registry container image. It doesn't really matter here.\n\n13. Reconfigure the container runtime on your Kubernetes nodes to utilize the internal registry as well for pulling images.\n\n14. Deploy 3 more VMs, these will host your Elasticsearch cluster\n\n15. Provision another VM. Remember the Elasticsearch cluster mentioned in the task before?\n\nWe need to get logs, so setup Logstash on this host. No pipelines need to be defined yet.\n\n16. Provision another VM. This one will host Kibana so you have a graphical interface for\n\nmanaging and looking at data stored in Elasticsearch\n\n17. Set up Metricbeat and Journalbeat on every host you have and configure them to push\n\ntheir data to your Elasticsearch cluster.\n\n18. Deploy another VM. This host will be responsible for monitoring your environment.\n\nUse whatever monitoring system you think has the most beautiful web interface.\n\nSome examples here are:\n\n\\- Icinga2\n\n\\- Nagios\n\n\\- CheckMK\n\n\\- Zabbix\n\n19. Provision another VM. This one will host a webserver of your choice with some static web content.\n\n20. Deploy another VM. This time, it will be a Nginx reverse proxy for the webpage you created in the step before. Configure this host only as a reverse proxy, nothing else.\n\n21. Remember that internal registry you set up? It's time to put it to good use and build a container that contains the webpage you created earlier. Build it and push it to the local registry.\n\n22. At this point, you should have published a container image to your local registry and have your Kubernetes nodes configured to be able to pull container images from that registry. Create a new deployment with your website along that current VM for your website. Add this new endpoint to the reverse proxy.\n\n23. Provision another VM. Yes this will be the last one, I promise. Make that server host a wiki software of your choice and document everything up to this step in there.\n\n24. Recreate all the above mentioned steps using Ansible playbooks. Do not destroy the current environment but create the new environment in parallel.\n\nBONUS:\n\n\\- Set up an internal git server, bonus for setting up gitea or gitlab-ce\n\n\\- Set up AWX instead of just using plain Ansible (14.1.0 is quite stable and works with docker flawlessly)\n\n\\- Set up a backup job(script) for your IPA environment. Make sure to use systemd-timers",

    "body": "My first job in IT was the good old everything position in an office with ~20 employees. If it had a power-cord then it was my responsibility (I did at one point \"fix\" the microwave by unplugging it and plugging it back in). At the time they had no file-sharing, no backup, anti-virus etc you get it. My skill level was somewhere around: Backup is key, but raid, for some unknown reason, is not backup.\n\nI did my best trying to improve the IT-environment while still prioritizing the users. Many mistakes were made but luckily no data was lost. Well with exception for some of my files, that one rsync command should have been the other way around. I kept things as simple and easy as possible *for the users*. Acceptable password policies, SSO, Windows with the software they were used to etc. Otherwise I did whatever I felt like, mostly with $dist when it made sense. Learned a lot, you know how it goes.\n\nI stayed until I felt restless and the environment was \"done\". Nothing left to improve, just regular old maintenance and helping out with this and that. So I left, worked my ass off at some other places for a couple of years and realized with time that this isn't for me. Luckily the current admin at my old job wanted out, so I'm back.\n\nThere have been no major changes over the years, but holy shit what is this env... It's so over the top. What I tried to accomplish was essentially more and more redundancy in an effort to eliminate single points of failure. But in doing so just made \"everything\" really unnecessarily complex, and have created the possibility of even more problems. Troubleshooting is time-consuming, but interesting. I'm now working on scaling down, removing stuff which we just don't need at an office this size.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is, I did get carried away back then, experimenting with all sorts of tech which should have stayed in my homelab until it made sense to implement it. I understand why I thought what I built was impressive at the time, and it's not that bad, buuut it also kinda sucks. So, imo, should have kept it simple :)\n\n*Edit:* [fieldmousebait](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/f2chwy/bit_of_a_rant_i_did_not_keep_it_simple_and_i/fhc575g/) describes my thoughts about the whole thing perfectly:\n\n&gt; The most common thing in a small office is overestimating the impact of downtime. You can build out very complicated systems to allow zero downtime, or you can just keep a cold spare on hand and backup the config, for example.",

After that I will still periodically check this post for updated questions or comments.\n\nThank you to the 33 companies and hundreds of people that supported this effort. This happened because the community made it happen.\n\nOur next target is OpenSSL 1.1.1 which is the first version to implement TLS 1.3. The update contains a lot of code changes that give us an opportunity to review and improve the code to make it safer.\n\nThe biggest way that you can contribute to us is by word of mouth. The more people hear about the positive work that we do, the more likely we are going to get donations, business contacts, and the logistical support that we need to operate and grow. We have many ways to contribute to our cause, some of them being completely cost-free. Check out our donations page to see how to help!\n",

    "body": "After a few years in the industry doing mostly non-Linux support and infrastructure work, I'm trying my best to move across to the Linux side of things. \n\nThe trouble is, though I am comfortable using Linux and have set up web servers, FTP, Wordpress and/or Drupal sites on AWS etc, none of this seems to be what job postings are interested in. Nor do there ever seem to be any junior or mid level Linux admin postings. \n\nSo it makes me curious, for those of you who work in Linux admin in one form or another, how did you get your start? Was it through friends or colleagues? Was it a junior role somewhere, if so what kind of role was it? \n\nLastly for people with a few years of experience who want to transition into Linux, what would help them achieve this? Would it be better to focus on getting a certificate like RHCE, or would it be better to just practice at home trying to learn shell scripting? Or set up home labs running web servers and database's etc. What would you value in a new employee joining you team? \n\nTIA!\n\nEDIT: Thanks for your feedback everyone, I got a lot of out this including me me me I like to talk about myself. \n\nJoking aside, it sounds like the vast majority of people knew someone or transitioned into a role after already establishing themselves in a company somewhere. To be completely honest this does not fill me with large amounts of hope considering I will likely be taking the 'respond to job posting, secure interview via recruitment agent' route. Well, at least until I make some more connections in the local scene, which is very who-you-know-not-what-you-know to begin with. \n\nAnd special thanks to those of your who answered the 'what would you value in a new team member' question as I think this is especially important to people in a similar position to myself. \n\nThanks again! \n\nYour favourite number one stalker\n\nEDIT: One last thing I'm hoping some of you can help with. What would you say is the best possible way to deliver the following:\n\n\"After x many years of system admin work I am confident of my potential in a Linux environment, the hours I've put into self studying my way through the RHCE I hope reflect my passion and commitment I have towards working with Linux. I feel at this point I am being limited by the lack of opportunities I have to spend time with it in my day to day role are what is holding my from taking my skills to the next level, and I am confident that when I find myself in a full time Linux role, my abilities will grow big time, in short I will absolutely fucking smash it.\"\n\n'Smash it' meaning, to become supremely capable with.

Around 90% of what I’ve seen so far are LVM disk issues and CPU-related errors.\n\nFor context, I hold the RHCSA certification, so I’m comfortable with the basics, but I want to make sure I keep growing and don’t fall into “newbie traps.”\n\nFor those of you with more experience in similar environments, what would you recommend I focus on? Any best practices, habits, or resources that helped you succeed when starting out?\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "body": "I just passed my LFCS exam with a perfect score and just wanted to give some tips for others pursuing this certificate. \n\n1. PRACTICE!!! the only way to really understand the tools and what they do is by running them. You can read as much as you want, but if you don't have affinity with the commands and arguments you'll struggle a lot and will take forever. I followed the Kodekloud course and did all the practice exams and Linux challenges they offer.\n2. Learn how to search for a command. If you need to change some ACL stuff but forgot the commands, use something like `man -k acl` to find all commands with acl in their name or description. If you are particularly lost, you can run the command with capital K (`man -K acl`) to also search the contents of the man pages.\n3. Install the `tldr` package as soon as you start the exam. This gives you handy oneliners for almost every command you'll need to know. I.e. `tldr find`\n4. Learn how to navigate the man pages -- understand their layouts and use case-insensitive searching (`-i`)\n5. Take your time reading the questions. This is a no-brainer, but this was consistently the reason I failed certain questions in the practice exams and is the easiest to avoid.\n\nThat's all, good luck!",

This is in stark contrast to nearly every other Linux-y place on the internet, where an bunch of guessers will either take a shot at the problem, or suggest something entirely different.\n\nSpecifically, there was recently a question about walking the SNMP tree to monitor disk space usage - and instead of pasting stackoverflow answers - or worse, telling the OP to use a “proper” monitoring tool, the answers were all based on real solutions formed by people in their real and working environments.\n\nI see it as a mark of maturity in this field to understand that no - walking a tree for disk stats is not ideal - but it’s what you must do, and I’ll help out.\n\nAnyway, just throwing that out there, hopefully it means something to someone.",

    "body": "In [this thread from a couple days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/1x0ql2/whats_a_linux_command_you_wish_you_had_known/) I mentioned that I used to be an Instructor for Red Hat and that many of us had an evil bag of tricks.\n\nAs an instructor, I occasionally came across either very cocky or very bright students that would go through the class work each day faster than anyone else. The bright ones I liked, they were always engaged and eager to learn. The cocky ones, well, they got old fast. Always first to pipe up and try to show off their knowledge to others in class. Sometimes even trying to test my own knowledge with obviously leading questions that they already knew the answer to. \n\nBoth types would often ask for additional work after they completed the day's tasks to help them brush up on troubleshooting problems. This is where the bag of tricks comes in. I always kept a list of various things I could do to the student's workstations to keep them busy for a while. These tasks were very good for taking the cocky ones down a notch or two. The bright ones loved the challenge. A few people asked for this list so I dug around and found a few to pass on. Many of these were passed on to me from other instructors. We even had a mailing list devoted to trading 'evil instructor tricks'.\n\n\nI'll type out the breaks I did to their systems, what I told them, and where appropriate I'll put a possible fix at the end of the post. Some of these have many ways to fix it. Mine is just one. I apologize for any typos. Instructors are, after all, just human. ;) I tried to make them as readable as possible within the limits of the reddit commenting system.\n\n**NOTE: Use any of the following at your own peril. Some _will_ break your machine. They were all recoverable by me in a classroom setting in under a minute but I make no guarantee for your systems. If you do break a system of yours using these and need help I'm always open to earn some sweet, sweet consulting money to help fix it. ;) Also, if you use these on fellow cow-orkers don't blame me if you get your ass kicked.**\n\nThis first one was always my go-to. If they asked for more I'd start down the list. The use of Google or any other online resource was not allowed to help fix any of these problems. They had to be done using only the tools on their server like in a test environment.\n==============\n\n1:\n\nWhat I'd tell the student: \"*Your server has been cracked. The baddies have changed your homepage and it's not flattering to your company. Get rid of their page and restore the index.html that was backed up to '/tmp/index.html'.*\"\n\nWhat I did to their system: 'cp /var/www/html/index.html /tmp' Make a change to the index.html. 'chattr +i /var/www/html/index.html'\n\nIn the 4 years or so I did this and dozens of students only one figured it out in a reasonable time frame.\n\n2:\n\nTo the student: \"*Some moron ran 'chmod -x /bin/chmod' on your server. Fix it. You can not reinstall the package that provides chmod.*\"\n\n\n3:\n\nTo the student: \"*Send me a copy of the output of 'ls /etc'.*\"\n\nThe break: Add this to their .bashrc. 'alias ls=\"echo \\\"I'm sorry, Dave. I can't do that.\\\"\"; alias alias=\"echo \\\"I'm sorry, Dave. I can't do that.\\\"\"; alias unalias=\"echo \\\"I'm sorry, Dave. I can't do that.\\\"\"'\n\n\n4:\n\nAs part of the classes we taught students how to use vi. Some basic knowledge of vi/vim is a must for any good Linux admin. I've seen nano users break way too many config files for my liking. If I caught them using something like nano I'd do this:\n\n'mv /bin/nano /bin/nano.nono; ln -s /usr/bin/vim /bin/nano'\n\n\n5:\n\n\"*Your system no longer boots. Figure out why.*\"\n\nThe break: 'mv /bin/bash /bin/bash.gotcha' then reboot their system.\nI would provide rescue media if they needed it.\n\n\n==============\nI have more but after a few of these most students were happy to return to redoing the bookwork over rather than ask me for more and more devious breaks of their workstations. To a seasoned admin these should be fairly obvious and easy to fix. When you're trying to go fast to show off for your instructor they get a bit harder. :)\n\nI really loved that job and found it very rewarding. Seeing the glimmer of understanding in a student's eye when they finally got that difficult subject matter made the frustration of dealing with others more than worth it.\n\n==============\n\n**Fixes:**\n\n1:\n\nYou can use 'lsattr' to see attributes on a file and use 'chattr -i /var/www/html/index.html' to remove the immutable bit.\n\n2:\n\nOne possible fix:\n\n    cp /bin/cpio /tmp; cat /bin/chmod &gt; /bin/cpio; /bin/cpio +x /bin/chmod; cp /tmp/cpio /bin; chmod +x /bin/cpio\n\n3:\n\nOne possible fix: 'builtin unalias unalias'. This tells bash to use it's built in 'unalias' command instead of using /usr/bin/unalias to unset the unalias. From there the rest is easy.\n\n4:\n\n    'rm -f /bin/nano; mv /bin/nano.nono /bin/nano'\n\nYes, I know about 'nano -w'. I've been doing this 20 years. I'm a 'vi' bigot at heart.\n\n5:\n\nBoot off rescue media. Mount the file system and start poking around. About 20% of students would find the renamed file. The rest would either reinstall the rpm or copy the bash binary from the rescue media.",

    "title": "My recent interview experiences (UK)",
    "body": "I was interviewing for positions earlier this year and thought Id write up my experiences. This was in the UK and applying for places outside of London (not interested in living there) mainly focussing on IT hubs like Cambridge, Oxford, Manchester, Edinburgh and Glasgow. \n\nMy background: 3 years experience working as a linux admin for a very small web based company, I was the only ops person. Experience with dedicated web servers as well as cloud infrastructure (not one of the big 3 though) and used tools such as Docker, Ansible &amp; Terraform. Several AWS associate certs as well as RHCSA and also decent Python skills with projects on Github. \n\n(I was applying from overseas so these were all done via phone or video)\n\nFirst interview: With a car AI firm, the position was platform engineer working with a huge &amp; complex AWS infrastructure and tbh I was out of my depth and wasn't sure why they were interested in me. I got hit with a lot of tough technical questions, as I had docker on my cv as I was asked to explain cgroups and how they worked which I couldn't. Crashed and burned pretty hard and the whole interview was a wake up call that I needed to hit the man pages and docs to brush up on somethings.\n\nSecond interview: Cant remember what the firm did but it was more of a traditional linux admin role with no use of cloud or devops tools. I screwed up on some technical questions again, wasn't able to explain how email worked (never setup an email server before) and had some programming question where I had to explain what maths equation I would use to sort change for a vending machine or something. The feedback I got via the recruiter later from them was that I 'lacked basic knowledge'. \n\nThird interview: With a cloud/devops firm, I was asked what I would do with a server that had 'suspicious activity', no other details were given and I was allowed to talk freely about this. I felt that I well on this and I went pretty in-depth but annoyingly it was with a HR person (who I assume was either recording it or taking notes) so I couldn't get any feedback.\n\nFourth interview: Devops firm. Given a programming challenge in the language of my choice, I had to write a program to do a full crawl of a website and put it on Github, asked to spend no more than 2hrs. This was difficult but I enjoyed the challenge and had actually done some web crawling before in my current job and personal projects. I actually spent way more than 2hrs (maybe as much as 10) but it was a good learning exercise. I couldn't get it to work properly (it would get stuck in a loop after crawling so many pages) and going into the code review interview I was stressed that they were going to grill me about my code quality, how fast it ran and unit tests etc etc. Instead they first thing they said to me was 'you have packaged the program using virtual env, why didn't you use docker?' I internally face palmed hard, I had spent so much time fretting about the code that I hadn't thought to do that which I guessed they expected as I had Docker on my resume. This was a code pairing interview with two other guys on video, they then started asking how I would set this up in Docker and as at my current job we used only official Docker images with Docker compose it had been probably 2 years since I had last built a Docker image myself and couldn't remember how to do it which was a bit embarrassing. This didn't seem to be a problem though and we worked through setting up the program on docker together. After a 3rd round interview later which went into my background later I was rejected as didn't have enough software development lifecycle experience.\n\nFifth interview: Fintech firm, very large high street company that had moved from on-prem to the cloud. This was for a cloud engineer role, I was given an app in a AWS cloud server and then told that the app needed to be connected to the internet, scaled, fault tolerant, secure and also expanded to work in continuous delivery, monitored etc etc. This was done via video screen share and I would explain exactly what I would build and then the interviewer would map it out. I was free to use any AWS or open source tools I wanted and to expand it as much as I desired. The interviewer would sometimes prompt me to add in something I might have missed eg 'ok so how are we going to monitor all this?'. I felt that I did pretty well on this one, the end infrastructure was scaled and fault tolerant using a huge amount of AWS tools as well as things like Terraform for provisioning, Ansible for config, Packer, Jenkins etc etc.  I was never given feedback on this but I was offered the position.\n\nThere were a few other interviews but they were just first round chats where we talked about my background and what I did at my current role, day to day activities. \n\nA few other observations:\n\nDevops is a job whether people like that or not. Id say at least 40% of the jobs were listed as devops with maybe 30-40% cloud engineer and the rest linux admin or platform engineer. I didn't see a single job listed as SRE.\n\nGetting into mid-tier devops roles is hard without software development lifecycle experience. Even though I had experience with a lot of the tools that are used and can program I often found with the devops roles that after several rounds of interviews and passing technical tests my lack of experience in this area cost me.\n\nLondon has an insane amount of jobs in this industry and with the right skills and experience you could get up to 80-100k GBP quite quickly. Cambridge has a lot of jobs too, for some reason also I saw a fair few Cambridge companies that offer to pay relocation costs but other companies around the UK don't . Further up north the pay is probably about 20-30% less than London/SE England but obvs. lower cost of living, still a lot of jobs in most of the major cities and not bad pay too.\n\n(Some) recruiters will tell you to try for a job even if you feel you aren't qualified, then you get told in the first interview you aren't qualified. Talk to recruiters and try and get a feel for their knowledge of this industry as some of them are just playing a numbers game.\n\nThe industry and jobs market seems to be very strong across all of the UK right now. As soon as I put my CV up on jobs boards and changed my LinkedIn status I was inundated with jobs from recruiters and I get the impression that some companies might be struggling to find the right people. \n\nHope that gives some insights to people here, happy to answer questions where I can.",

So we wanted to see how hard it would be to redistribute a livestream internally, so that there is only 1 connection going over the WAN pulling the livestream down. It was easier than I thought:\n\n`youtube-dl -f best \"VIDEO_URL_HERE\" -o - | ffmpeg -i pipe: \\`  \n`-fflags +genpts \\`  \n`-c:v copy -c:a copy \\`  \n`-sc_threshold 0 -hls_time 3 -hls_list_size 5 \\`  \n`-hls_flags delete_segments+omit_endlist \\`  \n`-hls_start_number_source epoch -output_ts_offset $(date +%s) \\`  \n`-f hls stream.m3u8`\n\nJust run this command in a folder that is accessible via a webserver and then point a player at the stream.m3u8 path (but tell the webserver to tell the webbrowser to not cache this file). In this folder it will create the .m3u8 file and the currently active video chunk files (5 chunks in this case), but will clean up old ones automatically.  \nCPU and RAM (and disk) usage is pretty much zero, since i am not re-encoding anything (-c:v copy, -c:a copy).  \nIf you want to use a web-player (so you can send out web URLs for everyone to click on) just use the demo HTML from [HLS js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js/) and replace the m3u8 URL with the path to yours.  \nAnd if you stop the ffmpeg command the player will just show the loading icon and when you start it again it will automatically start showing the stream again without user interaction.\n\nFinding the right ffmpeg parameters took quite some time, but now we can restream everything youtube-dl can handle: [supported sites](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html)\n\nI am posting this so I may save somebody a few hours of playing around with ffmpeg parameters :)\n\n(Edit: we used ffmpeg 4.1 (version in latest debian))",

    "body": "1) I have started studying for a career shift into IT, and I recently delved into the world of GNU/Linux, and have enjoyed it so much that I think I may pursue becoming a Linux admin. From what I have read here and a few other sites, Linux admins seem to actually enjoy their careers, and Windows admins seem to actively discourage people from entering IT. I personally don't enjoy using Windows, but why do you think that may be?\n\n2) I am also curious what you may think about my cert/career path. \n\nThe TL;DR of the path is A+ -&gt; Helpdesk -&gt; CCNA -&gt; NOC or similar -&gt; RHCSA -&gt; ???? further specialization will become apparent at this point.\n\n\nI am about to take the first half of the A+ to get my foot in the door with a help desk position (I've tried applying without the A+ in the past and never got a call back), next I would like to get my CCNA because networking interests me, and it seems important to understand networking well to be a good sysadmin - also I have seen quite a few sysadmins recommend putting in some time at an NOC. It also seems to be a lot easier to get a job at an NOC than a Jr. Linux admin position. Does pursuing the CCNA make sense, or would it be a waste of time? Is there something else I should devote my time to?\n\n3) I'm also curious how well I should be able to program/script? I'd like to pick up Perl, Bash and/or Python (these seem to be recommended the most), but at the moment all I know is basic Javascript. I could probably put together a calculator in JS. I actually quit learning programming around this point because I just wasn't very good. Will I have to be better than this? I know I won't ever have to code a calculator, but you get the gist.\n\n4) How much on call and overtime do you do? \n\n5) I've seen it recommended a few times to focus on Unix. I currently have CentOS installed on a VM, and will probably spin up SlackWare soon for the fun of it, but which environment would be the best to spend the majority of my time in? I won't be pursuing an admin job for the next 2+ years, so I'm wondering if getting to terms with Unix is a good idea now, and I can pick up what I need to know about RHEL while studying for the RHCSA.\n\nThanks for your time!",

I bought a stripped down PC a couple of years later with Lindows on it, and since that time I've run Linux exclusively.  I'm endlessly tinkering with all things Linux. I'm comfortable with Debian based distributions as well as RPM based. I run Arch on my main rig, with Bedrock Linux on my secondary hard drive (Ubuntu-Mate/Arch) and CentOs on my server.

    "title": "Merging With Two Other Companies And I'm The \"Tech Guy\"",
    "body": "My wholesale company (purchases, shipping, inventory management) has been chugging along successfully for about eight years now. The entire company runs on Debian. From mail, web, databases, even the average desktop, everything is running Debian Buster. Accounting is done in a Windows VM running Sage Accounting. In fact, any time we have a need for a Windows program (which isn't often), we simply install it on a VM on someone's desktop.\n\nWe are now in talks to merge with two other companies, boosting our yearly sales a whole order of magnitude, and the consensus is to keep me on-board as the lead IT guy. The other companies outsourced everything so they never held on to any employee who might know something about IT. The very reason for my company's success is my implementation of low-cost solutions to everyday business problems, so me being head IT guy is, to them, a no-brainer.\n\nOf course, I know that I'm completely out of my depths here. I'm having serious doubts that my set up will scale so quickly. One of the companies was using Zoho almost exclusively for everything. I know nothing about this software, but apparently, Zoho Inventory can't handle the ~15,000 SKUs that we'll have in our combined catalogue.\n\nSo I'm appealing to the /r/linuxadmin community for some sort of guidance.\n\nIt seems to me that some sort of ERP software is called for, but it's tough to figure out which one would fit our needs with all of the marketing-speak they\nuse. My current system is fine for up to 10 employees. I now need to have it going for up to 50 employees. Zoho seemed like a good solution, however I'm quite surprised to hear that it can't handle that many SKUs. Is an all-in-one solution like Zoho the best way to go? Maybe I'm better off picking separate tools for each purpose like I'm doing now.",

    "title": "Should I be annoyed at this guy?",
    "body": "So I've been stewing on this for some of the weekend, and I've tried not to, I know it's not healthy, but still.\n\nMy company makes cross-platform software. We run primarily Linux and Mac. Unfortunately, as much as I protested, we have one user who refuses to use either and installed Windows 10 (his own license) on his company-issued computer. As we are a small company, and didn't have an IT policy before I joined, management compromised, saying I have no requirement to support him (good for me, although I had to read MS' EULA to make sure he was okay to use his personal license...).\n\nOur choice of Linux is Ubuntu. Everyone was running Xenial when I joined, and I've extensively tested the upgrade to Bionic. Since support for Xenial is still ongoing, I've not rushed anyone to upgrade and have run upgrades as requested. I'd rather have people productive than on the latest shiny.\n\nLast week, one of our developers discovered that the version of CMake that ships with Xenial has a few issues with our product, and we would be better served by using the version in Bionic. Fair enough. This sounds like a good reason to draw up a schedule and push the holdouts (about 20 people) onto Bionic, now it's been out for a year and is known stable. In addition, there's newer versions of other tools, such as icecc, that work much better. There's other options, of course, such as running the binary locally, but due to the mess this winds up creating in a development environment (let's face it, we're all messy when it comes to dev tools), having the right version installed system-wide seems the most sensible.\n\nMost of the developers welcome the change, although because adopting the new version will break compatibility with the Xenial version, there's a few outcries about being forced into the upgrade. Okay, I get where they're coming from, and as nice as it would be to maintain compatibility, if it means we can move past some long-standing issues, a bit of disruption during the upgrade is a small price to pay.\n\nDuring this discussion on Slack where we note the lack of pre-built binaries for Xenial and that it's not in backports, the Windows guy decides to chime in, and this quote is verbatim:\n\n&gt;Just compile from the god damn source:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;&lt;links to a tarball and the usual build instructions&gt;\n\nI was quite shocked he took this attitude.  \n1. this issue does not affect him because he's on Windows.  \n2. he is completely ignoring the sensible methods to admin Ubuntu.  \n3. he's belittling my efforts to follow best practises.\n\nThis wasn't a private chat, either, it was team-wide.\n\nIn a private chat, I explained to him why this is a bad idea on Ubuntu (removing the package from tracking by APT) and that I don't want the overhead of maintaining different versions (building from source in an active project, I'm sure every person is going to get a different binary) or packaging the thing myself. He didn't back down, saying that if he wanted the latest features from a compiler, he would build it from source. Nor did he think that he phrased it in an offensive way (I said to him that, had he asked 'what's wrong with compiling it from source', I wouldn't have felt the need to message him).\n\nI felt quite offended by the way he decided to emphasise his opinion. Yes, building from source is an option on Linux, and on some distros is the Only Way To Do It, but not so much on Ubuntu.\n\nHe's also dropped occasional comments about the way Linux handles certain things, suggesting that us Linux users are deliberately making life harder for ourselves, when in fact I have most everything automated and working together seamlessly. Having done Windows admin in the past, my experiences with Ubuntu have been refreshing, to say the least. I prefer being behind a bash prompt to *any* Windows management tool.\n\nI feel a bit better now, thankfully.",

Even if you make it to an interview and you don't get the job, use that experience to carry to the next opportunity. Your perception plays a big part in how you conduct yourself. Although the possibility of getting a job or not is 50/50, assume that if you don't get accepted for a job that the one meant for you is just around the corner and that rejection experience was meant to prep you.

    "body": "Hi all, \n\nWe just released **netdata v1.14** !\n\nThis release contains 14 bug fixes and 24 improvements  \n\nThe release introduces major additions to Kubernetes monitoring, with tens of new charts for **Kubelet**, **kube-proxy** and **coredns** metrics, as well as significant improvements to the netdata **helm chart**.\n\nTwo new collectors were added, to monitor **Docker hub** and **Docker engine** metrics.\n\nFinally, v1.14 adds support for **version 2 cgroups, OpenLDAP over TLS, NVIDIA SMI free and per process memory** and **configurable syslog facilities**.\n\nImprovements:\n\n- **go.d.plugin v0.4.0** : Docker Hub and k8s coredns collectors, springboot2 URI filters support.\n- **go.d.plugin v0.3.1** : Add default job to run k8s_kubelet.conf, k8s_kubeproxy, activemq modules.\n- **go.d.plugin v0.3.0** : Docker engine, kubelet and kub-proxy collectors. x509check module reading certs from file support\n- Added unified cgroup support that includes v2 cgroups\n- **Disk stats** : Added preferred disk id pattern, so that users can see the id they prefer, when multiple ids appear for the same device\n- **NVIDIA SMI** : Added memory free and per process memory usage charts to the collector\n- **OpenLDAP** : Added TLS support, to allow monitoring of LDAPS\n- **PHP-FPM** : Add health check to raise alarms when the phpfm server is unreachable\n- **PostgreSQL** : Our configuration options to connect to a DB did not support all possible option. Added option to connect to a PostreSQL instance by defining a connection string (URI)\n- **python.d.plugin** : There was no way to delete obsolete dimensions in charts created by the python.d plugin. The plugin can now delete dimension at runtime.\n- netdata supports sending its logs to Syslog, but the facility was hard-coded. We now support configurable Syslog facilities in netdata.conf\n- We encountered sporadic failures of our kickstart installation scripts after nightly releases. We add integrity tests to our pipeline to ensure we prevent faulty scripts from getting deployed.\n- **Kubernetes Helm Chart** improvements:\n  - Added serviceName in statefulset spec to align with the k8s documentation\n  - Added preStart command to persist slave machine GUIDs, so that pod deletion/addition during upgrades doesn't lose the slave history\n  - Disabled non-essential master netdata collector plugins to avoid duplicate data\n  - Added preStop command to wait for netdata to exit gracefully before removing the container\n  - Extended configuration file support to provide more control from the helm command line\n  - Added option to disable Role-based access control\n  - Added liveness and readiness probes\n\n\nBug Fixes:\n\n- Fixed cases where the netdata version produced by the binary or the configure tools of the source code was wrong. Instead of getting something like netdata-v1.14.0-rc0-39a9sf9g we would get a netdata-39a9sf9g\n- Fixed unexpected crashes of the python plugin on macOS, caused by new security changes made in High Sierra\n- Fixed problem autodetecting failed jobs in python.d plugin. It now properly restarts jobs that are being rechecked, as soon as they are able to run.\n- CouchdDB monitoring would stop sometimes with an exception. Fixed the unhandled exception causing the issue\n- The netdata api deliberately returned http error 400 when netdata ran in memory mode none. Modified the behavior to return responses, regardless of the memory mode\n- The python.d plugin sometimes does not receive SIGTERM when netdata exits, resulting in zombie processes. Added a heartbeat so that the process can exit on SIGPIPE\n- The new SMS Server Tools notifications did not handle errors well, resulting in cryptic error messages. Improved error handling\n- The installers would crash on some FreeBSD systems, because sha256sum used by the installers is not available on all FreeBSD installations. Modified the installers to properly support FreeBSD\n- Running netdata behind a proxy in FreeBSD did not work, when using UNIX sockets. Added special handling of UNIX sockets for FreeBSD\n- Fixed sporadic build failures of our Docker image, due to dependencies on the Polyverse package ( APK broken state).\n- Fix segmentation fault in streaming, when two dimensions had similar names\n- Kubernetes Helm Chart: Fixed incorrect use of namespaces in ServiceAccount and ClusterRoleBinding RBAC fixes\n- **Elastic search** : The option to enable HTTPS was not included in the config file, giving the erroneous impression that HTTPS was not supported. The option was added\n- RocketChat notifications were not being sent properly. Added default recipients for roles in the health alarm notification configuration\n\n\n---\n\n[Check the release log at github](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/releases).\n\nIf you are new to netdata, [check a few live demos at its home page](https://my-netdata.io/) and the [project home at github](https://github.com/netdata/netdata).\n\nNetdata is FOSS (Free Open Source Software), released under GPLv3+.\n\n&gt; Enjoy real-time performance and health monitoring!",

    "title": "Netdata, the open-source real-time performance and health monitoring, released v1.18!",
    "body": "\nHi all, \n\nRelease v1.18.0 contains 5 new collectors, 19 bug fixes, 28 improvements, and 20 documentation updates.\n\n**At a glance** \n\nThe **database engine** is now the default method of storing metrics in Netdata. You immediately get more efficient and configurable long-term metrics storage without any work on your part. By saving recent metrics in RAM and \"spilling\" historical metrics to disk for long-term storage, the database engine is laying the foundation for many more improvements to distributed metrics.\n\nWe even have a [tutorial](https://docs.netdata.cloud/docs/tutorials/longer-metrics-storage/) on switching to the database engine and getting the most from it. Or, just read up on [how performant](https://docs.netdata.cloud/database/engine/#evaluation) the database engine really is.\n\nBoth our **python.d** and **go.d** plugins now have more **intelligent auto-detection** by periodically dump a list of active modules to disk. When Netdata starts, such as after a reboot, the plugins use this list of known services to re-establish metrics collection much more reliably. No more worrying if the service or application you need to monitor starts up minutes after Netdata.\n\nTwo of our new collectors will help those with Hadoop big data infrastructures. The **HDFS and Zookeeper collection modules** come with essential alarms requested by our community and Netdata's auto-detection capabilities to keep the required configuration to an absolute minimum. Read up on the process via our [HDFS and Zookeeper tutorial](https://docs.netdata.cloud/docs/tutorials/monitor-hadoop-cluster/).\n\nSpeaking of new collectors—we also added the ability to collect metrics from SLAB cache, Gearman, and vCenter Server Appliances.\n\nBefore v1.18, if you wanted to create alarms for each dimension in a single chart, you need to write separate entities for each dimension—not very efficient or user-friendly. New **dimension templates** fix that hassle. Now, a single entity can automatically generate alarms for any number of dimensions in a chart, even those you weren't aware of! Our [tutorial on dimension templates](https://docs.netdata.cloud/docs/tutorials/dimension-templates/) has all the details.\n\nv1.18 brings support for installing Netdata on offline or air-gapped systems. To help users comply with strict security policies, our installation scripts can now install Netdata using previously-downloaded tarball and checksums instead of downloading them at runtime. We have guides for installing offline via **kickstart.sh** or **kickstart-static64.sh** in our [installation documentation](https://docs.netdata.cloud/packaging/installer/#offline-installations) . We're excited to bring real-time monitoring to once-inaccessible systems!\n\n**Improvements**\n- **Database Engine**\n    - Make dbengine the default memory mode\n    - Increase dbengine default cache size \n    - Reduce overhead during write IO \n    - Detect deadlock in dbengine page cache \n    - Remove hard cap from page cache size to eliminate deadlocks\n\n- **New Collectors**\n    - [SLAB cache mechanism](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/slabinfo.plugin/)\n    - [Gearman worker statistics](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/python.d.plugin/gearman/)\n    - [vCenter Server Appliance](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/go.d.plugin/modules/vcsa/)\n    - [Zookeeper servers](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/go.d.plugin/modules/zookeeper/)\n    - [Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) nodes](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/go.d.plugin/modules/hdfs/)\n\n- **Collector Improvements**\n    - rabbitmq: Add vhosts message metrics from /api/vhosts \n    - elasticsearch: collect metrics from _cat/indices\n    - mysql: collect galera cluster metrics \n    - Allow configuration of the python.d launch command from netdata.conf \n    - [x509check](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/tree/master/modules/x509check): smtp cert check support\n    - [dnsmasq_dhcp](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/tree/master/modules/dnsmasq_dhcp) : respect conf-dir,conf-file,dhcp-host options \n    - plugin: respect previously running jobs after plugin restart\n    - [httpcheck](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/tree/master/modules/httpcheck) : add current state duration chart \n    - [springboot2](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/tree/master/modules/springboot2): fix context\n\n- **Health**\n    - Enable alarm templates for chart dimensions \n    - Center the chart on the proper chart and time whenever an alarm link is clicked \n\n- **Installation/Packages**\n    - netdata/installer: Add support for offline installations using kickstart.sh or kickstart-static64.sh \n    - Allow netdata service installation, when docker runs systemd \n    - Make spec file more consistent with version dependencies\n    - Fix broken links on web files, for DEB \n    - Introduce separate CUPS package for DEB #6724 and RPM. Do not build CUPS plugin subpackage on CentOS 6 and CentOS 7 \n    - Various Improvements in the package release CI/CD flow \n    - Remove RHEL7 - i386 binary distribution, until bug #6849 is resolved \n    - Bring on board two scripts that build libuv and judy from source \n\n\n---\n\n\n[Check the release log at github](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/releases/tag/v1.18.0).\n\n\nIf you are new to netdata, [check a few live demos at its home page](https://my-netdata.io/) and the [project home at github](https://github.com/netdata/netdata).\n\nNetdata is FOSS (Free Open Source Software), released under GPLv3+.\n\n&gt; Enjoy real-time performance and health monitoring!\n\n```",

    "title": "Are the \"ivory tower\" Linux guys not using the command line any more or something?",
    "body": "I just tried CentOS 7 for the first time and I keep stumbling across various more-or-less terrible changes to the CLI environment. I'm sure these are familiar to everyone - systemctl instead of service, ip instead of ifconfig, firewall-cmd instead of iptables. And so on.\n\nSo the natural reaction is to make a post about \"who moved my cheese\" and complain about why perfectly good things got changed. This is not that post. I understand that systemd is a thing, that it makes laptops run longer on their battery or machines boot faster or whatever, and that reloading the entire firewall every time you make a slight change is pretty dumb. I accept that these changes are for the better and embrace the new technologies. Progress is great and good and sometimes involves discomfort.\n\nMy question is - why does the command line interface to all the new stuff have to be so verbose and poorly thought out?\n\nI mean, OK, we've got a new firewall configuration layer on top of iptables, and this is for some reason a good thing. But the command to configure it is \"firewall-cmd\" - 12 characters. And I can't even type \"fw&lt;tab&gt;\" - because part of the same package is called firewall-offline-cmd - a naming choice that seems almost specifically designed to frustrate shell command completion. There's just no way to do it *fast*. Or at least, not as fast as I'm used to.\n\nOr here's another one. The new firewall-cmd requires that you issue any given change twice, once to update the running configuration and another to update the permanent configuration. There doesn't seem to be any way to save the running configuration to permanent. (Online sources recommend you make all your changes as --permanent, then do --reload, which utterly defeats the purpose of having the new abstraction layer.)\n\nBut ok, let's roll with it. Let's trust our upstream developers and assume they had some very good reason not to provide this functionality. So the natural thing to do at the CLI is to make the change, then hit up arrow and run it again as --permanent. Except that firewall-cmd requires that --permanent, if specified, must be the first option. So the number of keystrokes to perform the task is tripled. I can't for the life of me imagine why the order of the commands could possibly matter - don't we have getopt for that? Hasn't this been a solved problem for 30 years?\n\nAll these new commands are just painfully awkward, and don't fit the style of CLI that we've been used to with the GNU tools. I mean, maybe they're still *slightly* less verbose than PowerShell, but at least PowerShell has tab-completion of options rather than just files.\n\nMany people have made the same complaint with systemctl's reversing the order of the service name and the command (systemctl start httpd instead of service httpd start), meaning you can't up-arrow and change the command easily. But then we have other issues. When you run \"systemctl restart httpd\" you get no output. Did it do anything? You can see it takes a second run, but ... did it actually do anything?\n\nI bet the GUI tells you if it did anything. GUIs don't have buttons you click on that silently do things with no visible indication anything is happening.\n\nAnd I wonder if that's the point? Is new development on Linux now focusing on the GUI, with the CLI an afterthought? Or is there some cool new way of interacting with the CLI that I just don't understand?\n\nWhat's the deal with this?",

    "title": "Today I killed half our server subnet... But how did it happen?",
    "body": "So a little background to this story. I was playing around with kickstart on CentOS 7 to build a custom ISO image for my department so we can accelerate the installation process of new servers a bit.\n\nI was constantly editing the kickstart file, rebuilding the ISO, deploying it and see if it did what I wanted it to do, so far nothing abnormal (at least in my eyes).\n\nI configured the network, (this time with predetermined values like our DNS servers or the gateway, yay) and clicked \"Begin Installation\" once more. While that was running I received a call from one of our customers, telling me that while he worked on a MySQL server he suddenly lost connection to the server and can't even ping it anymore.\n\nI started to investigate the issue and while doing it a colleague of mine said that our monitoring reports many servers to be unreachable. I told the customer that there seems to be something bigger going on and I will keep him up to date while investigating the root cause.\n\nAs it turns out, all affected hosts were in the same subnet (let's say 10.10.10.0/24), were all Linux hosts (we have some Windows hosts in the same subnet as well) and with all of them the network configuration looked fine.\n\nWe checked our Hypervisors first as we didn't have a network colleague at hand atm, but after a while noticed that it had to be a network issue. So tried to catch some and eventually reached one of them while being on the highway. He got out the next exit and stopped at a cafe to help us remotely to solve the issue. I gave him some information and after a while he told me that it looks like a server in that subnet had the same IP as the gateway. He gave me the MAC of the \"malicious\" host and I looked it up...\n\nTurned out it was the virtual NIC of my test server. I immediately shut the VM down and just like that (as you can expect) all issues were resolved.\n\nI was kind of baffled, though. The test server was in the \"Installation finished - Reboot\" screen of anaconda when I shut it down, so I \"unplugged\" the virtual NIC and booted it back up to check the network configuration. Did I really set Gateway IP (10.10.10.1) as it's IP (10.10.10.110) and made an error while being caught up in routine?\n\nI checked the network-script for the NIC, but it reported everything as fine. I set 10.10.10.1 as Gateway and 10.10.10.110 as IP.\n\nSo this is where I don't get what was going on. How is it possible to turn out with a different IP address during installation than after installation? I am pretty confident that Anaconda sets the IP I have previously configured during the installation. So either after booting it should've said `10.10.10.1` as IP in the network script or Anaconda should have had `10.10.10.110` during installation.\n\nWhile driving home I told this whole story to a colleague and good friend of mine that had this day off. While I was recalling all the events that happened I noticed that in the kickstart file I set the \"default\"/predefined IP to `0.0.0.0` as I thought it's non-routable anyway, so it shouldn't be an issue. So the only conclusion that I can draw until now is that for some reason, even though I changed the IP in Anaconda before activating the NIC, it set the IP `0.0.0.0`, thought \"hey, that's the default gateway, which is set to `10.10.10.1` and therefore set it's own IP to `10.10.10.1`. This still doesn't explain to me why after the installation the NIC was correctly configured, but it's the only explanation I have so far of the issue.\n\nSo that's how I dumped half our server subnet. I'm still searching for explanations, maybe I'm just super dumb and don't have enough experience to know that I did a very basic mistake. So I would love to hear your thoughts as well!",

There's something that bothers me, something that doesn't add up.  PewDiePie does a bunch of things, on Arch, that many old timers would have trouble reproducing.  Sure, given time and a bit of effort, all of those things are possible, but quite a few of the things he did in the video are NOT beginner things, and certainly not just 5 minutes of googling.  The thing that doesn't add up is him calling himself \"not a technical guy\" and then going ahead with a notoriously hard distro and doing a bunch of things that are arguably things that takes effort.\n\nLastly, I do fear that he did the Linux community a disfavor by basically promoting Arch linux, despite his disclaimers and explanation that it is a difficult to use distro, to non-technical people.....

A dog's vomit pile of USB flash drives is hardly the most efficient, the most practical, the most technically advanced, or the most professionally-looking way of promoting the practice. I prefer it this way because its intersection between the cost, the redundancy and the predictable simplicity vectors best suits my current needs. ...and of course it's nuts.\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* Ventoy?** It's a bootable container for live-medium disk images, or actual distro installers, that saves a user from having to flash those same disk images on separate removable media, like USB flash drives or CD-ROMs. As for actually fully installing those distros inside the storage Ventoy partition, like I've otherwise done on these USB flash drives, I'm not sure that it's its intended purpose. I didn't think that the qualification I made in my original post, in the phrase '*have actual distro installations*' was so hard to miss.\n\nAs for all the other suggested containerization and virtualization solutions? Before leaving Windows altogether, years ago, I remember trying one of the mainstream distros within Windows' Virtualbox, and I found out the hard way that the hardware connectivity translation a VM implements can sometimes hide actual hardware incompatibilities that are then laid bare ...on bare-metal installations. Proxmox? Yeah, Linux is that versatile that it excels equally on servers and end-user machines alike, but I didn't want to go to that level of technical complexity just to test drive distros, when I don't need to. To use a bunch of USB flash drives for distro hopping is an irreverent homage to the kind of experimenting that otherwise is viewed differently by those not yet familiar with what Linux can offer. Let's all take it as being just that, shall we.",

    "body": "I switched myself to linux a while ago, mainly for enthusiasm and wanting to try something new, and ended up realising how bad windows has become in the process, i'm no expert but here's what i learned:\n\n1.What is linux, and what's a distribution?\n\n -Linux is actually just a kernel (the core of an operating system), so When we usually say \"Linux\" we mean GNU/Linux, GNU is a set of open source tools necessary for any modern operating system.\n \n-A Linux distribution, is a version of that GNU+Linux implementation, each distro with some tweaks, perks and features.\n\n2. Why should you switch in the first place?\n\n -Security and transparency, no company is gonna dare bundle spyware on their distro. Since everything is open source, even users can get the source code and take a look at what the company is doing and even modify the distro.\nAlso, linux has generally less malware made for it.\n \n-Its free and lightweight, Windows 11 requires 64GB of storage to install, and at least 4GB of ram. Whereas ZorinOS for example, requires 15GB of storage and 1.5GB of ram.\n\n-Its resource efficient, that's why in many game titles, Linux outperforms Windows 11 despite having to run a translation layer and having worse driver support.\n\n -Extremely customizable, you can customize any aspect of your OS, literally.\n\n -Open source software is awesome, trust me bro.\n\n3. Things to consider:\n\n -While game and app support is improving, and translation layers like Wine and Proton exist, some apps and games just won't run, including Photoshop, fortnite and Valorant. There's an alternative for everything tho (like GIMP for Photoshop).\n \n -You will have to learn and get used to a few things in linux, like the terminal (used to control &amp; perform operations using commands).\n\n-There are around 600 distributions currently maintanted, so its important to choose the right one for you, there are also different distribution families, the most popular of which is Debian and its derivatives, so if you are new to linux go with Ubuntu, ZorinOS or mint (the 3 are Debian based). There are also distros made specifically for gaming like Nobara or steamOS.\n\n-You can try a linux distro without installing it, using a live USB drive.\n\n-Nvidia drivers aren't up there yet for linux, so you might get a slightly worse performance in games with Nvidia GPUs.\n\n\nI hope this helps, please correct me if i'm wrong.",

    "body": "I'm a regular contributor to this forum, and I try my best to help those in need of help, on their journey into the Linux universe, but as Windows 10's end draws nearer, more and more people are faced with the stark choice of either having to fork out a shit load of money for absolutely no good reason other than to buy new machines, just because Microsoft is not letting them upgrade to Windows 11 on their existing ones, or having to flee the Windows universe, and migrate to Linux.\n\nHowever, Microsoft's greatest evil is to have forced consumers for so long into taking up Windows, simply because computer retailers don't sell computers from mainstream OEM's that have anything else other than Windows on them. At least Apple makes its own toys, and puts its own OS *only* on its own toys.\n\nAnd as Windows 10's D-Day draws nearer, I get to read questions from its refugees that simply highlights the troubling epidemic of absent curiosity. More often than not, I get to see questions from people that need way too much hand-holding, simply because Microsoft, in its haste to protect vapidly parasitic corporate greed, has kept Windows users from maintaining their curiosity in working order, only to have it atrophied to the point where even basic online research skills are missing.\n\nI migrated to the Linux universe well before Windows 10 reared up its ugly head, and yes, being rather tech-savvy (the last desktop PC that I bought 'off-the-shelf' was more than 20 years ago because I've only assembled my own machines ever since) had a lot to do with my contempt towards Microsoft and the way its toxic presence was depriving the world of its freedom of choice, as well as any reasons to remain curious.\n\nFor all those who've never seen anything else, or known anything else other than Windows, believe it or not, there was a time when computers didn't automatically come with an OS already installed on them, let alone only what Microsoft shoved down people's throats. And there was a time when other OS makers ran rings around MS.\n\nIt's time for the world to turn a corner and rediscover a world of computing free of Windows and its suffocating dominance.\n\nEDIT: I took to Linux not because it was free, as in no up-front payments, but because it's collaborative open-source premise meant that there was nothing hidden from the end users, and the thousands of coders and maintainers encouraged you, the person at the other end of the equation, to learn and share their creations openly, which invariably meant that you, the end user, by using what they've created, contributed to their on-the-field-testing part, so that if any problems crop up, they could fix it as soon as they knew of it.\n\nThat's why Linux is worth your time and your efforts to learn it. It's time to let your inner childhood-like curiosity to get you to start asking yourself \"I wonder what happens if I do this...\" more often.",

Of course there are people who are not promoting Mint but something else but it is just that major society concern made by users who recommend Mint that it is always go to distro. \n\nPersonally i think there are better and more functional and modern distros than Mint today, like for example Kubuntu which uses KDE very biginner friendly DE with also a lot of funcionality also there are other possible choises like Nobara and Bazzite for gaming, Cachy OS for speed, all of which are also using KDE, also even a beginner might want to be able to fo something in terminal so they might want to use something like Fedora, Debian, Endavour OS, also in some time Pop_!

He's been using it for about a few months now, and besides some minor troubleshooting, he seems to be doing just fine. The other day, I decided to ask him what he knows about Linux at this point. After some talking, apparently he doesn't even know why some commands are prefaced with \"sudo\". While initially feeling like a furious teacher, I realize now how convenient Linux can be for someone who knows little about the ecosystem.",

I believe this because of the leaps I take at any opportunity to customize my experience in 90% of what I use.\n\nDoing my own research, I thought about trying Mint, since it's very similar to Windows. However, he recommended Endeavour.\n\nI wanted some suggestions. I believe that even though Mint isn't as customizable as other distros, it must be much more than Windows 10.\n\nAttached to this post is a screenshot of an image I saw on [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) from an account that has since been banned.\n\nI would LOVE to know how to get this User Space.\n\nI fell in LOVE with it and am willing to learn the ropes to have a computer like this.\n\nWhere should I start and what should I aim for to achieve this?\n\nThank you for your attention!",

I'd like to try a new distro, just to experiment, and to maybe use my brother's laptop (with his permission) as a sort of janky home-theater setup.\n\nPictures attached, but I'll put here too: it's an Asus VivoBook 14, with AMD Ryzen 3 3250U, 8 GB ram, 64 bit. I'm assuming also an AMD graphics card? It has Windows 11 on it already (ugh) and it's slow af, very little space, the Bluetooth sucks, and it can't seem to run Minecraft well but supposedly Terraria works.\n\nI just wanna use it as a better smart tv, basically. Got it plugged in now over HDMI to just mirror the screen, and if I can get some kind of remote/controller/etc working to use it from the couch, or even just play a small pixel game like stardew or Wizard of Legend, or Hyper Light Drifter, really ANYTHING on controller, that would be a huge plus! I started the process of getting Bazzite (got Ventoy on a USB, ready to add the ISO file to the folder), but according to the bazzite docs, this laptop can't run it? Or at least, not in Steam Gaming Mode, which is what I think would fit my needs exactly.\n\nBut maybe I read the page wrong? Or, I mean, I'm willing to try a different distro. Or just free up space on the laptop, install steam, and keep windows? (I'd rather not). Again, I'm new to this and not tech savvy or anything, so I figured i could try asking people who know way more about this than me!\n\nTL;DR: what's a good distro to use on a ~~terrible~~ tiny (but new-ish) laptop to turn it into some kind of home theater/SUPER light gaming device?",

    "body": "\nFor the longest time, I used an old laptop running Windows 8.1. It was... fine. But deep down, I never really felt safe using it, especially after a mistake I made years ago.\n\nI once installed some cracked software. Yeah I know, big mistake. I deleted it not long after, but that paranoia stuck with me. I always had this uneasy feeling that some hidden malware might still be lurking in the system.\n\nBecause of that, I avoided logging into any important accounts from that laptop. I just didn’t trust it anymore.\n\nAt one point, I considered reinstalling Windows. Maybe a clean start would help.\n\nBut then reality hit me: Windows 8.1 doesn’t get security updates anymore. That means no patches, no zero-day fixes.. nothing.\n\nAnd switching to Windows 10 or 11 wasn’t a great option either. My laptop’s specs (Celeron N2840, 4GB RAM, and still using HDD) just aren’t built for it.\n\nThat’s when I seriously started looking into Linux.\n\nAfter doing some research, I decided to take the leap: I wiped Windows completely and installed Zorin OS Lite.\n\nWhy Zorin? A few reasons:\n\n- It’s lightweight (it use XFCE desktop).\n\n- It runs shockingly well on older hardware.\n\n- And most importantly: it’s beginner-friendly.\n\nTo my surprise, everything I needed was already there. All the apps I use have Linux versions, and Zorin’s built-in Software Store even had more up-to-date options than I expected.\n\nOn Windows 8.1, I’d already started running into compatibility issues.. more and more apps just wouldn’t support it anymore.\n\nBut here on Linux? My laptop feels alive again.\n\nNow, for the first time in years, I actually feel comfortable logging into important accounts. No more nagging fear of spyware. No more worrying about missing security patches.\n\nJust a clean, fast, open-source OS that respects my privacy.\n\nIf you’re in a similar spot: on an older laptop, stuck with outdated Windows, feeling paranoid like I did, then I highly recommend giving Linux a shot.\n\nIt might just be the best decision you make for your digital peace of mind.",

    "title": "Switching to Linux made me love my computer again.",
    "body": "I've been using computers for almost 40 years now. I consider myself a power user. Over the years, I've used systems like the Commodore 64, Amiga, Macintosh, and PC. Most of my time was spent with Windows.\n\nHowever, for the last 15 years or so, using a computer had become more of a habit than a passion. New versions of Windows kept coming out, but instead of adding innovative features, they started stripping things down and they called it \"user experience.\" It reached a point where I felt like they were dictating which software I should use, what features I should have access to, and how I was supposed to use my computer.\n\nEventually, I very well realized that my Windows operating system was doing all sorts of things in the background. It was sending and receiving data over the internet without telling me or asking for my permission. Using my personal computer began to feel more like using a company-owned or shared machine. That seriously bothered me.\n\nWhen Windows 10 support was announced to be ending, I upgraded to Windows 11 and unfortunately, I discovered that all of the issues I mentioned above were even worse in it. It felt like the computer was no longer mine. Even during the installation process, setup forced me to sign in with a Microsoft account. That felt like a roundabout way of saying, *\"You must be connected to the internet, because we want your data. No data, no install.\"*\n\nThat's when I joined the migration from Windows to Linux. For the past month, I’ve tried out many different distros and hopped from one to another. Since I’m -somewhat experienced computer- user, I didn’t face any major issues, even with my initial hesitations about some distributions. I thought my NVIDIA card would cause major problems but I only had minor annoyances. In terms of user experience, using Linux has been incredibly satisfying. As I learned to use the terminal more and more, I started moving away from the GUI. I now get my daily tasks done faster and more efficiently, and it’s actually enjoyable. Learning Linux made me love my computer again.\n\nI haven’t felt this kind of excitement about technology in a long time, probably not since the 90s, when I installed a 3Dfx Graphics Accelerator into my PC and launched \"Quake II\". In terms of gaming performance, Fedora (which I currently use and settled) holds up surprisingly well -if not on par- compared to Windows.\n\nTo be honest, I’ve burned the ships behind me. I converted all my storage/backup drives to Linux file formats and I have no plans to go back. I feel like the time and effort I’ve invested into this system is truly paying off.\n\nSo, to those reading this who feel trapped in the Windows ecosystem, don’t be afraid. Don’t hesitate. On 99% of the computers out there, you can have the same experience I had. And if you have any problems, there are thousands of people willing to help you.\n\nLastly, I want to say thank you to Linux and its community.  \nI'm glad you are there.",

    "body": "With the end of Windows 10 support in a few days, and Windows 11 being the most intrusive OS to date, many people might consider switching to Linux. Since there are a bunch of distros (AKA distributions) out there, choosing one can feel overwhelming (I know I was overwhelmed when I first started to learn about Linux).\n\nSo here are my recommendations for anyone ditching Windows for good:\n\n**Linux Mint (Cinnamon Edition)**\n\n* Very familiar interface to Windows 10\n* Stable, reliable, beginner-friendly\n* A lot of media codecs already preinstalled so videos and music just work\n* Great gaming support thanks to Steam and Proton compatibility layer (I've run several Windows-only games this way)\n* One of most popular distros, so there are tons of quality guides\n\nI've been using Mint for well over a year now, and I genuinely. In fact, I even posted about [my experience using it for a year](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmint/comments/1mubg8k/today_marks_one_year_of_using_linux_mint_daily/).\n\n**Fedora (KDE Plasma Edition)**\n\n* Traditional desktop layout, similar to Windows, that can be customized to your heart's content\n* Lightweight, but feature-rich\n* Faster update cycles than Mint (meaning more up-to-date software)\n* A lot of things preinstalled, which can sometimes be a bit overwhelming, but you'll get used to it quickly\n\nThere's also the Workstation edition based on GNOME desktop environment, which doesn't let you customize as much. Basically, the philosophy behind it is \"less is more\". It looks very modern, and takes a bit to get used to since it doesn't look like what most people are used to with Windows. It works better on laptops because of the trackpad gesture options.\n\n**Some things to know beforehand**\n\n* Back your data before installing! Seriously. Get an external hard drive, and store all your important files there because you'll lose them once you decide to install new OS.\n* You can try the Linux without installing it first by making the \"Live USB\". Basically putting the OS on a USB stick, and selecting in BIOS to boot up from USB first.\n* I know it's daunting, but you can relax: You don't *have* to learn terminal. Modern Linux distros come with GUI tools for almost everything. Learning the terminal later is super useful, but not necessary right away.\n* On that note, installing software is super easy, barely an inconvenience. Use the built-in Software Manager. It's basically like the App store on your phone, just for Linux programs.\n* Flatpak is your friend. It's a way to install programs without worrying about compatibility issues. You can find a bunch of cool stuff to install on [Flathub](https://flathub.org/en), which will quickly become your favorite \"hub\" website.\n* Distro-hopping (trying different distros) is fun and all, but there's no need to chase the \"perfect\" one. Because there is no perfect distro. Most users won't need the niche features a lot of distros offer anyway. I recommend choosing one, and sticking with it. Mint and Fedora are both excellent and you'll be happy with either.\n\nI am sure people in the comments can add more to pros for both Mint and Fedora, and I welcome all to do so.\n\nEnjoy your newfound freedom.",

    "body": "I LOVE IT. \n\nContext: my 2019-ish hp laptop straight up wouldn't update after a certain point (it had plenty of space), and even a clean install wouldn't work at all. Which was an issue because it would take 40-60 minutes to warm up enough to use Firefox without it freezing at every click. Plus, it acted like my WiFi connection was crazy unstable (which it isn't, judging from my other devices), and it seemed like it didn't have Bluetooth when, it did. \n\nIn the last few years I've tried pretty much all the driver related troubleshooting I could come across, but nothing it would only get worse. And Win10 won't get support anymore starting sometime in October.\n\nI was going to get a new laptop even though I just need to be able to write documents and browse the internet well enough. I asked for advice on here since said new laptop would start with no OS, and you people (lol) got me curious about Linux distros for beginners. I looked at the Linux mint site and just couldn't help but want to try it.\n\nSo, I moved all semi-important files to an external hard drive and installed Cinnamon with a USB stick.\n\nIt worked great, and the PC is snappy like it's literally never been before. Everything works from what I've seen, I changed the keyboard layout and added Japanese IME input as well (the language I set is English so of course it would assume my keyboard isn't Italian), but it all went pretty smoothly. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth fully work, and I loved seeing the different themes. (It's a small thing, but I like that stuff)\n\nI know I don't know a LOT of stuff, and I'll need to troubleshoot at some point. But that's the only way to learn. For now, I'm happy with it :)",

Me and my friend has been thinking about trying out Linux for a very long time now, it's just that we didn't care enough to actually try it out. But then after Felix built his first PC, he installed Linux Mint on that thing and Arch Linux on his laptop and saw how cool it is to customize your own desktop and everything and I thought maybe I should try it out. I mean there is nothing to lose if I try it out.\n\nNow I know that Linux Mint is RECOMMENDED for beginners trying out Linux, but for me, I really wanted to try out Arch Linux no matter how hard it is. I'm planning on Dual-booting it with my old extra HDD that's installed in my PC (I have 2 other SSDs btw), I just don't know how to do it.\n\n=====\n\nEDIT: WIth all things considered. I decided to go with what the comments say. I'll try out Linux Mint first because that's what Felix did before moving to Arch Linux and see where I go from there. Still worried about the Dual Booting though.\n\n=====\n\nEDIT 2: I have successfully installed Linux into my old spare HDD with ease. Create a Flash Media or something like then flash it using balenaEtcher, then Live Boot off of that, then from there you can choose to try it out or install directly there. If you did choose to install it from Live Boot, it's a pretty straightforward proccess, it's like installing a program from Windows, just be careful which drive you mount your Linux from. It also downloads GRUB for you so Dual-Booting is already solved.",

    "body": "I am a long Windows user and I am tired of constant restarts, freezes and other software related issues. After watching a lot of encouraging youtube videos claiming Linux novadays works flawlessly and is so user friendly, I decided to give it a try.\n\nI have a quite modern Thinkpad and I’ve chosen Fedora KDE. Booted it up from USB stick. It looks nice, but I started having issues from the very beginning.\n\n1. ~~Opened YouTube. No sound.~~\n2. ~~5g WiFi doesn’t work. No error, no internet. Regular WiFi works.~~\n3. ~~Date is in US format. Changed all regional settings to my country. It still shows time in US format in the taskbar.~~\n4. ~~Tried playing movie from network drive- codec is missing. Copied command to install codec from Fedora official docs- command didn’t even run. Error about some unrecognised parameter. Somebody on Reddit suggested installing VLC through flatpak. I’ve done that, still same codec error.~~\n\nI spent like 30 minutes trying to figure those out without any luck. I have some experience with Linux running vps and a home server, but this is just too much. Am I doing this wrong? Or maybe I am just too weak for linux.\n\nEDIT:\n\nDidn't expect so many comments, thanks to everyone trying to be helpful and encouraging. Almost all the initial problems were resolved by simply installing Fedora to hard drive instead of running from USB.\n\nLockscreen date shows wrong format only on the initial login and it doesn't bother me at all. Codec issue resolved by replacing flatpak VLC to dnf and installing additional codecs.\n\nCouldn't get KIO GDrive working, installed rclone instead. rclone is a bit complicated to install, required setting google api, rclone itself and systemd service to run in background. But at least it seems to be working fine.\n\nThen my Windows rdc files did not work. Figured out krdc doesn't support domain prefixed usernames, then also had to adjust Color depth and Acceleration to fix the broken image. BUT after adjusting all the settings it looks great.\n\nSo my conclusion after using Fedora for a couple of days it is actually really great, but it requires investing some time to configure and get used to. It feels a lot snappier and cleaner than Windows. I really like all the options to customize KDE. It doesn't have any of my Windows complains (maybe just yet) - sleep/weak up works great, no force restarts, multiple monitors and docking works great, no slowness. ",

It's response sometimes gives me a little breadcrumb to go look up another fix - so it's helping me to be the token prediction system and give me ideas of what to try next but not actually using any of its code. \n\nThought this might be useful to someone getting started - remember that the way LLMs are built make them unsuitable for a lot of tasks that are more niche and specialized. If you need output that is precise (like coding) you ironically need to already be good at coding to give it strict instructions and parameters to get what you want from it. Open ended questions won't work well. ",

    "body": "I prepared a long answer to a post that was deleted, here it is as this is a recurring question: what antivirus should I installed on my Linux PC? Should I pay $50 for this or that?\n\nTL;DR: **Avoid these pieces of software like the plague! Do not buy any antivirus for your Linux machine**. It is not useless, it is toxic!\n\nA bit of history:  \n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline\\_of\\_computer\\_viruses\\_and\\_worms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_computer_viruses_and_worms)  \n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware#History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware#History)  \n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer\\_worm#History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_worm#History)  \n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus\\_software#History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software#History)\n\nSo:\n\n1. John von Neumann wrote a paper about self replicating computer programs in 1949. [Fred Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Cohen) published \"Computer Viruses – Theory and Experiments\" in 1984. He published his PhD thesis on the topic in January 1986. All these were formal computer science papers, but there are some conclusions that can be applied to real life anyway: no algorithm that can perfectly detect all possible viruses.\n2. Morris worm, one of the first Internet worms (and the most famous?) was released in November 1988. \"Worm\" in that sense was first used in a 1975 novel. [The first computer worms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creeper_and_Reaper) appeared on ARPANET in the 70s.\n3. The first PC virus (MS/DOS) was Brain in 1986. After that there were California, Jerusalem in 87 or 88 IIRC. I saw an antivirus software (from Eliashim Microcomputers) for the first time in 1988.\n\nSo... Viruses, worms and other malware have been theorized for more than 40 years, or even 76; they have been designed experimentally for 50 years, and really malicious programs and AV software appeared \\~ 40 years ago.  You could think that anti-malware is a mature technology and that the malware problem has been eradicated. This is not the case.  \n**Blacklist (signature based) scanners do not work and will never work** \\-- read Fred Cohen's papers if you did not understand that. Behavior detection is a bit better but far from perfect; in practice, it does not work either.\n\nActually, **computer security is one of the few technical domains where it is possible to sell and resell utterly inefficient technologies**. e.g. in 2000 IDS did not work and most companies that sold them collapsed when the dotcom bubble burst; IDS were repackaged and sold as IPS ten years later.\n\nAs far as security is concerned, current antivirus implementations are just horrible: one big opaque bloatware that runs with System privileges and regularly downloads opaque updates without telling you what it is doing. The attack surface is enormous.\n\nBy the way, many Linux AV install proprietary kernel modules. This is probably useless as the kernel already provides kazillons of security mechanisms or [modules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Security_Modules), and this is toxic as it will be compatible with just the right kernel version... Said in another way, you might be blocked with a vulnerable kernel version if the company does not recompile their module when an updated kernel version is available.\n\nBe kind to your system and your wallet: do not buy these software, learn how Linux security works, install and configure a good RBAC system if you want more than the basic Linux access control (AppArmor or SELinux are the most known, they come with default policies), run backups to be able to restore your system when it is infected, keep your computer up to date, do not install any suspicious software on your machine, if you need to do that, use a virtual machine or a container, etc. etc.\n\nTo give you an example how rotten this market is even for big companies... [MS ATP](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint) is supposed to be a more serious enterprise solution. Not so long ago, their Linux agent [audited](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Audit_framework) **every** system call and crashed big databases servers. See [https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5490181](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5490181)  or [https://www.reddit.com/r/DefenderATP/comments/venvig/defender\\_on\\_linux\\_logging\\_too\\_many\\_events/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DefenderATP/comments/venvig/defender_on_linux_logging_too_many_events/)\n\nIf you really want something to check your system, you can have a look at anti-rootkits:  \n[https://www.unhide-forensics.info](https://www.unhide-forensics.info)  \n[https://rkhunter.sf.net/](https://rkhunter.sf.net/)  \n[https://www.chkrootkit.org/](https://www.chkrootkit.org/)  \n[https://github.com/dgoulet/kjackal](https://github.com/dgoulet/kjackal)",

Today, 97 percent of its workstations, over 103,000 computers, are running GendBuntu, the Gendarmerie's custom Ubuntu-based Linux distribution.\n\nand then there's the German state Schleswig-Holstein which is also saying goodbye to microsoft, citing security, cost, and privacy concerns.   \n  \nIn 2010, Malaysia switched 703 of its state agencies to free and open-source software, including a Linux-based operating system.  \nHeck, even some US government agencies are already using Linux lol.\n\n\n\nGovs around the world are already moving away from Microsoft, gaming is improving day by day thanks to valve and its proton translation layer, all we need is another screw-up from Microsoft to push more people to switch. giving software companies insentive to develop for linux.\n\nAnd While i don't think Linux is perfect, it has its issue, mainly the distro fragmentation issue. i hope more govs including that of my country fully switch to Linux, Open Source software is unbeatable.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1gqstsny4fff1.jpg?width=627&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=639b3fc1fb32a590bf5a354e1b7f4dc013b29e97\n\n",

    "body": "After 20-ish years I'm forced to ditch Windows because it crashes multiple times a day and erases whatever I haven't saved.\n\nFilled with maidenish hope, I downloaded Linux Mint Cinnamon - the \"easy\" distro, they tell me - and so far...\n\n- I can't install Open Office to do word processing, which is really all I would ever want to do on a computer.\n\n- I can't use Wifi after the laptop has gone into sleep mode even once. Before that there's a list of available wifi, but after that it says Wifi Unavailable, and I have to restart to get the original list back.\n\n- Every time I restart it erases not just my unsaved work, but everything, literally everything: all my settings, preferences, apps, programs, downloaded stuff, the works - it even switches off dark mode!\n\nWhenever I look for help I get told (or see other people getting told) things like \"You shouldn't be using Open Office anyway\", or endless threads describing the program I have to write in order to get the program I want to run to actually run! I suppose I could slowly get used to that amount of additional labor if I had to, as the price one pays for stability, but it seems no one can agree on exactly what I'm supposed to type into the terminal thingy to make anything happen. I try typing in what they tell me and I get stuff like \"command invalid\" or \"that drive does not exist\" or some such malarkey.\n\n(It's 2025; why hasn't anyone invented the start button yet?)\n\nBasically with Linux I can't get anything to start, and with Windows I can't get anything to keep going. Both of them seem to be an obstacle to my tasks, a menace to my data, and a perversely seething reservoir of motiveless malignity. And sadly, after this brief trial I'm inclined to conclude that neither OS is really useful for the average person in the street who wants to do anything other than worry about their thrice-damned computer all day.\n\nShould I do the unthinkable and buy an Apple? I know they're a cult, but at least their gadgets work.\n",

It’s old, but not trash, the specs are:\n\n* Intel i5 6300HQ (6th gen, quad-core)\n* GTX 950M\n* 32GB DDR4 (yeah I maxed it out lol, even mixed 2400 and 3200 sticks)\n* 512GB NVMe SSD (Kingston NV2 Gen4, even though the mobo only supports Gen3 - it still works, just not full speed)\n\nSo I figured, let’s push it and install Windows 11 on it. Used Rufus to bypass all the TPM/Secure Boot/CPU checks. It worked... **for a few weeks**.Then Microsoft did what it does best: force updates that ruin everything.Laptop started **randomly crashing**. Boot loops, blue screens, total instability. Event Viewer kept screaming about **Intel TPM Provisioning Service** errors. I disabled TPM in BIOS. Still crashed. I nuked and reinstalled:\n\n* Windows 10 Pro 22H2 - crashed\n* Windows 11 LTSC - crashed\n* Ghost Spectre debloated ISOs with all updates and telemetry gutted - still crashed.\n\nTurns out, **Microsoft basically killed TPM 1.2 support silently**, even on builds where it's technically still \"supported.\" And when you dig into it, newer versions of Windows 10 and 11 still try to initialize TPM/IME/virtualization stuff at a kernel level, even if you turn that crap off in BIOS. So even if your hardware is fine, Windows will gaslight you and crash anyway.Here’s the kicker: \\*\\*I installed Linux Mint 21.3 Cinnamon, and it runs like buttery smooth. No crashes. No warnings. No drama.\\*\\*And the real plot twist?**I'm now running Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 as virtual machines INSIDE Linux Mint** using VirtualBox - assigning 8 - 16 GB of RAM per VM - **on the same old laptop that can’t even boot them natively anymore.**  \nLet me say that again: **Linux Mint is running Windows more stable than Windows itself can**.  \nSo yeah, I’m done. Microsoft turned a perfectly fine machine into e-waste with software. Linux Mint turned it into a productivity beast again. No forced updates. No telemetry. No random crashes. No TPM bullsh8t. Just clean, fast computing.This is why I’ll keep recommending Linux for older hardware. Not because it’s “free” - but because it respects your machine and your control over it.",

    "body": "I see this all the time. People not having a good backup plan and then using ChatGPT to configure something on their system. Even people trying to help saying \"chatgpt said this:\".\n\nI really want to make this clear: This is a *terrible* idea. It can work in 9/10 cases, but on the 10th it will break everything. I've seen people saying \"well for me it always worked\" and that's great, but please do not tell others to blindly trust the output of LLMs. \n\nUse a distro that is on your skill level, don't install an Arch based system as your first install for example. Use Mint or Fedora until you get comfortable. Try Arch within a VM or on a spare SSD if you really want, but even then don't blindly trust LLMs. It will just hallucinate a command that looks and sounds right but doesn't actually work. Then you'll create a spiral of GPT trying to correct its own mistakes but actually making it worse. The more you try the more it will break.\n\nI actually had a super bad experience myself just an hour ago. I dual boot Void and Bazzite and wanted to solve some obscure issue on Void. I found nothing online so I tried GPT. Within two commands (that didn't look dangerous to me even as a more experienced user) it managed to brick both Void and Bazzite. Actually really impressive because Bazzite is usually pretty unbreakable. Now I'm lucky to have everything backed up and partitioned in a way that makes sense. I can spin up a new system within 20 minutes and keep all my games and files. Most people don't. Most people have all their stuff on one drive, in one partition without copy.\n\nI went in with the full expectation that it might break everything.\n\nBack up your files and be smart about where you get your commands from. There are amazing wikis that aren't too hard to follow for just about any distro. I'll be off reinstalling my system in shame.\n\nEdit: got lucky and got it running again with a BTRFS snapshot and a live system. Make sure to set that up if your distro supports it.",

    "body": "I have recently been considering the possibility of returning to using Linux on my desktop, but I am surprised to see the lack of security awareness in Linux, especially among beginners or in the advice given to them.\n\nIt is as if the typical “don't worry, there are no viruses in Linux” has taken such a hold that people believe Linux is an impenetrable deity. Some examples:\n\n1) It is recommended to use Ventoy to try out different distros and find the one that works best for you, but at the same time it is acknowledged that the software contains a multitude of blobs, making it difficult to be fully auditable (and reminiscent of the XZ blunder, which also affected Ventoy), and there are even [Redditors calling attention](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1buhnrs/comment/kxtic9r/) to the dubious quality of the program. But people are like \"whatever, it's fine I suppose\".\n\n2) Arch-based distros are sometimes recommended, and then using AUR software if necessary, even though malware has been found there several times ([for example](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1m3r2mo/arch_linux_pulls_aur_packages_that_installed/)), and that's normal, it's a user repository. Beginners won't understand anything and will be very inclined to download whatever they need from wherever they need it to make whatever work for them, or to get the software they need. Beginners don't know how to or can't audit code or software themselves. Similar things could be said of Ubuntu/Mint PPA.\n\n3) Similarly, a lot of software assumes that users must add their own repositories for it to work, and even detail this in their guides. A beginner doesn't know what that entails. Or software in “stores” such as Flatpak, which may offer packages packaged by third parties that have nothing to do with the official developers and, in theory, could at some point do their own thing, similar to what the malicious agent behind the attack on XZ intended to do. An example is the private browser Mullvad Browser, which you could search for and install from Flatpak back in the day. A beginner would do so, unaware that they are installing a package made by “Joe Smith” from his basement in Georgia.\n\nAnd I won't get into other debates about what is sometimes recommended to facilitate user migration to the Linux desktop, such as: “Bitlocker style encryption? You can use LuKS, but I wouldn't bother. Why do you need it? Come on! You want to encrypt your already installed disk? Well, reinstall it. You can't activate it on the fly like in Windows, but why bother? It will only add problems.”\n\nOr the fact that Linux it's sold as being able to run Windows software without any problems, without mentioning that this also brings with it the same possibility of being infected by Windows malware.\n\nSometimes I get the feeling that people feel much more invulnerable on Linux, and many people think it's okay to lower their guard to the minimum, even to absurd levels.\n\nWhat is your approach to security when using Linux? What would you advise a beginner (and while we're at it, what distro do you use)?",

    "body": "My old Macbook is finally dying, and I've been getting pretty fed up with Apple, so I figured I would make the switch to desktop Linux. I have little prior experience with Linux, but I'm a reasonably technically savvy person in general; I do some personal web development and have set up simple Linux VPSs, know how to use the command line, etc.\n\nI saw Ubuntu recommended as the most polished and beginner-friendly distro, so I went with that. It has not gone well. A brief list of issues I've encountered:\n\n\\* There's some bug with Nvida graphics cards that causes noticeable mouse lag on my second monitor, along with freezes whenever I do something that's graphics-intensive.\n\n\\* Even with no second monitor in use, sometimes Ubuntu will just randomly freeze while I'm playing a game.\n\n\\* Sometimes when I close the laptop and reopen it, it has crashed.\n\n\\* Ubuntu's recommended browser of Firefox is extremely slow at some tasks, practically unusable. I tried switching to Chrome, but Chrome has its own intermittent freezes, and there's some bug where a tab can get \"stuck\" while I'm moving it and prevent me from continuing to move it.\n\n\\* There's a bug that causes my mouse to get stuck when I move it from one display to the other if it's too close to the top of the screen.\n\n\\* I had hoped that moving to Linux would give me more customization options, but it appears the breadth of tools available is quite poor. For example I was looking for a simple backup utility that would function similarly to Time Machine on Mac, and it appears there are none. Reading old threads on other people asking for the same thing, I see a bunch of Linux users recommending things that are not similar at all, or saying \"oh you can easily emulate that by writing your own bash script\". Like, sure, I am capable of doing that, but when users are having to write their own solutions to simple tasks it's obvious that the existing app repository is insufficient for its core purpose. I also tried to find a simple image-editing program like Preview on Mac, and there was nothing; I can either pick between Gimp with its extremely high learning curve or various other programs that are covered in visual bugs and can't even do something like \"drag corner to resize image\".\n\n\\* Opening Steam can take more than 30 seconds, and then I have to wait another 30+ seconds for an actual game to open. Even opening the terminal sometimes forces me to wait for multiple seconds.\n\n\\* Most concerningly of all, it appears that the Snap store has no human review, and [frequently contains malware](https://forum.level1techs.com/t/malware-in-the-snap-store-again/208817)? And that Canonical claims that individual Snaps are sandboxed, but this is actually not true, and even a \"strict mode\" snap can [run a system-wide keylogger](https://www.aquasec.com/blog/snap-trap-the-hidden-dangers-within-ubuntus-package-suggestion-system)? Frankly: what the *hell* guys?\n\nAnd all of this in less than a week. I can only imagine how many more issues I would discover in the years that I would like to use this laptop.\n\nLike, I'm really trying here. I love the ethos behind open-source, and I'm willing to do a bit of extra config work and suffer through some minor inconveniences to use Linux as my default OS. (I didn't mention the dozens of more minor issues I've come across while trying to get my system set up.) But as it currently stands, it just doesn't feel like Linux (or at least Ubuntu) is actually ready for practical use as a desktop environment by people who want to spend their time doing things other than debugging Linux issues.\n\nHave I just had a uniquely bad experience here? Maybe some of these are hardware issues, I should buy a new computer, switch to a different distro, and try again? Or is this just the best that's to be expected from the Linux ecosystem right now, and I should suck it up and buy another overpriced Macbook? I don't know whether my experience here is representative, I would appreciate hearing from others who are also just trying to use Linux as a practical work and leisure environment.",

Try Digikam with Darktable?\n* **Linux was not designed to run Windows software.** It can sometimes (via Wine, Bottles, or Proton), but that’s a workaround, not the main act. Gaming is sort of an exception, if you game with Steam, yes, most things work because Valve poured money into making it work. More Windows games work on Linux than do on Mac, that seems certain. Fire up Steam and (mostly) enjoy! Otherwise, please see the bullet above. There are text editors, office suites, IDEs, music players, DAWs, video editors, web browsers and email clients galore in the Linux ecosystem, but if you never get around to uh-- applying these applications, you are NOT \"using Linux.\"\n* **Desktops eventually break when you treat them like toys.** If you’re new, learn to walk before you try to build a cyberpunk dashboard with 60fps shader effects and 12 translucent panels. Imagine a Linux user installing Windows on a laptop, then going to the Control Panel and spending 48 hours mashing...every...single...button, and then hacking the Registry for a few days before going to Reddit and saying \"Windows broke, it sucks using WIndows.\"\n* **The Terminal is not a weakness of Linux you need to avoid**. It's a powerful tool you should learn about, with an open mind. IT IS NOT a goal, of any major Linux project, to get rid of it ever. That would not be viewed as an improvement by the Linux community. You need to get your head around this.\n\nIf you just want a stable, fast, secure OS that respects you--use Linux as Linux.  \nIf you want to endlessly tweak for the aesthetic? Fine. Just don’t act surprised when it implodes. Also, please consider NOT trying to quadruple boot your Windows machine. TBH, just take your windows disk out and swap in a new one and run Linux. So many new folks on here creating problems for themsleves.\n\nUSE your package manager. DO NOT type in commands from ChatGPT you don't understand, and if Wine is the first thing you install... you might not be \"using Linux\".",

While I understand there are very specific cases where Linux excels, I’m more interested in broader scenarios that might justify making Linux my primary operating system, rather than something I use only occasionally.\n\nTL;DR: What are the practical reasons to choose Linux over Windows for everyday tasks, gaming, and programming?",

    "body": "Hi all.\n\nI'm here to share everything I have learned so far using Linux, while remaining a Linux noob to help others similar to me. If you're not a noob, you will probably cringe a lot.\n\n  \nMy past attempts, years ago, with Linux always ended up in failure. When the Steam Deck was released I decided to try it out, loved it. When M$ decided to end support to Windows 10 soon and loaded Win 11 with even more spyware and ads, I decided to try Linux on desktop.\n\n  \nStarting with the Steam Deck (Arch based), it's a pretty much console experience, with some pc capabilities. For the most part you use it as intended and let Valve make sure you have all the latest goodies in a safe environment. It wouldn't make a great system for a desktop computer but it could work well as a custom gaming console.\n\n  \nI tried Manjaro (Arch) on my pc. I thought that since it was also Arch based like the deck, it would be similar. In many ways it is, but without daddy Gabe's hand to guide you, it is very easy to break stuff. It has all the newest bells and whistles but compatibility with software can be an issue (most applications can't catch up with Arch so they don't support it). I broke the system within a couple of days, trying to do stuff it wasn't meant to.\n\n  \nThen I went for Ubuntu (Debian). As the most popular distro among noobs, it has the widest compatibility with apps. However, they seem to be turning into the Apple of Linux. I also hated the Gnome environment. Trying to instal KDE broke the system. Bye Bye!\n\n\n\nThen I went for Mint Cinnamon (Debian) a second time (the first time went badly but it was a very long time ago). \n\n\\+I loved the Cinnamon environment which is pretty much the same to me as KDE. \n\n\\+Their desklets allowed me to configure my secondary mini screen into a system monitor adequately, not quite how I was envisioning it but beautiful nontheless. It was certainly prettier than the things you see in r/Conkyporn with less resource drain (seriously, Conky may be powerful at making system monitoring widgets but it takes too many resources to be of any use). \n\n\\+I was able to install Chrome and NordVPN very easily because it is based on Ubuntu, without all their annoying stuff, so compatibility is brilliant. -\n\n\\+Setting up the timeshift utility to take daily snapshots to a different drive (it's like system restore for windows, only much much better) allowed me to experiment and try many stuff, a lot of which ended up in failure but I could just restore everything and try again, meaning that I learned a lot and had fun in the process. \n\n\\+I love Mint and recommend it to everyone. But it's not without it's flaws.\n\n\\-Debian distros focus on reliability rather than experimentation and freshness. As a result, most stuff are fairly outdated. It is still using a very old kernel (the heart of linux, the thing that connects all Linux distros) and fairly old GPU drivers. As a gamer, I'm used to always ensure to have the latest drivers with every new game.\n\n\\-I also couldn't figure out how to play Alan Wake 2 on it, so I ended up installing Windows on a partition on a different SSD just for this game.\n\n  \nI decided to install Bazzite (Fedora Atomic) on a different ssd than Mint (the same as Windows), to see what all the fuss is about. They claim it is inspired by the Steam Deck OS, while being a very capable desktop OS. At first, I wasn't impressed by the setup process. \n\n\\-I had to manually make the partitions so that it wouldn't wipe my windows installation. \n\n\\-I also discovered that Atomic means that the system is semi locked down, you are less free to make changes to the system and install things as easily. Trying to setup NordVPN on it made me realise that everything I had learned in Mint wouldn't help much here. The only thing that did carry over is that I shouldn't try to brute force stuff and things would work out like it usually does in Windows so I took it slow. \n\n\\+I was able to instal snap as a download source using the 'sudo dnf install snapd' command and then find Nord in the Discover software center. Getting there was harder than it sounds because every discussion I could find on the topic would steer me into wildly different directions. But now that works!\n\n\\+I found it has a much greater pool of widgets than the desklets that Mint has, allowing for a much more powerful monitoring screen, although positioning them properly can be a bit of a chore but it's worth it.\n\n\\+Buzzite is using a very fresh stable Kernel and the latest GPU drivers as far as I can see, which resulted in a significant improvement in framerates in gaming, very visible results, about 20 more frames per second! I was even able to get Alan Wake 2 running, with framerates that were also about 20 more fps than Windows! I'm very impressed!\n\nBuzzite is quickly becoming my new favourite distro. It has unlocked more power from my PC, even though it seems a bit more inflexible, which also means it's harder to break, and I haven't found a backup utility like timeshift in case that it does break. I will be making it my daily driver for now, but Mint is staying in my back pocket SSD. \n\n  \nFeel free to ask any questions you may have and I may be able to help, or to roast my inexperience and mistakes.

MS Office is far better than Libre/OpenOffice (just my opinion. don't cancel me for this. credit where it's due, but they’re not there yet), Adobe tools are miles ahead of GIMP, and Windows is just more convenient and smoother to use overall. Even “user-friendly” Linux distros like Mint has given me troubles in the past (I’ve used Linux for a few years as daily driver)\n\nI tried dualbooting. NTFS issues, EFI corruption risks. The RTC conflict (UTC vs. local time) is another headache. Sure, there’s a workaround, but it’s yet another thing to worry.\n\nWSL has no real low-level or hardware access. Many packages are broken and/or don't work expecting a proper linux system. Things like `nmap` and `airmon-ng` either don't work or are crippled.\n\nVMs are heavy on resources, even on my gaming laptop.

Or should i use a VM to test the waters to get a basic feel of the System?\n\n  \nEDIT AFTER REPLIES AND ADIVCE: I want to thank you all for the advice and recommendations onto my next step for my Linux Journey. \n\nMain Takeaways:\n\n\\-I should avoid Arch Linux for the time being\n\nTo confirm this, i loaded up EndeavourOS on a VM, and the first thing I tried doing was installing Sudo, couldn't get it to work after 30 minutes, later deleted the VM.\n\n\\-I should use Linux Mint\n\n   While I hear strong praise for this distro for gaming, i heard that Mint is not the most updated Distro for AMD since it is relied on Ubuntu or something like that. However it might be my top 3 distros i might choose\n\n\\-Anti-cheat systems games are borked.\n\n   Fortunely, I dropped these kind of games a year ago, Valorant, COD, and Siege. \n\n\\-Bazzite (OS that is mainly based around Gaming), CachyOS (Arch-Based, and praised for its shockingly gaming performance and its ease-of-use with minor tinkers.) \n\nAfter all considerations, i have bought a flash USB, i will try out CachyOS and use it on my recent NVME drive (it barely has 5 steam games, thats all the files). Thank you guys for all the recommendations and guiding me in my next step of hopping over to Linux. ",

CachyOS is based on Arch so I get you can say \"I use arch btw, kinda\". Not sure how it works with Nvidia but AMD should work just fine.\n\nBazzite - Do you like the steam deck? You will love this distro, has all the drivers needed for your GPU (amd, Nvidia, etc) and as someone who uses it, I love it. It is sadly immutable as it is based on the Fedora Atomic Desktop so if you want to become a tinkerer, this is just not for you, however this allows for stable rollbacks if you ever have any issues updating.\n\nNobara - Heavily modified version of fedora targeting the gaming community, made by Glorious Eggroll (creator of ProtonGE which is a fan made version of Steam's compatiblity later with a lot of fixes). Have seen some bugs on their subreddit but it is overall an okay distro.\n\nDeveloping:\nAny distro works but I know that isn't much of a help, this list is short with only one answer but here it is:\n\nBazzite DX - This is Bazzite's developer experience made for gamers and developers, this is just the same as Bazzite but with more tweaks and customisations for developers. Can be installed by doing the normal Bazzite installation and then rebasing to it (instructions on bazzite.gg).\n\nContent Creation:\nUbuntu studio - Don't know much about it but it has all video and audio drivers installed and I believe you can install Kdenlive as a video editor.\n\nGeneral use:\nUbuntu - A classic, plenty of tutorials online with a large community ready to help, easy to install, easy to learn, and overall a smooth experience.\n\nLinux Mint - Ubuntu but it looks more like windows, still a great option + PewDiePie uses it.\n\nZorin OS - Affiliated with endof10 and is a great distro to get to learn the world of Linux whilst still feeling like your in windows - ads or bloatware. Quite fast too.\n\nPotato pcs:\nPuppy Linux - not much to say except it's really lightweight.\n\nLubuntu - lightweight ubuntu, DE doesn't look the best but it works if you want speed on a old computer.\n\nTech lovers:\nArch - Great distro, have had issues with Nvidia drivers in the past but I believe the situation is improving. It is a rolling release distro meaning updates practically daily if not more frequently (you don't have to do them all the time, just run sudo pacman -Syu in your free time to stay up to date). Quite easy to install with arch install script, still recommend watching a tutorial.\n\nGentoo - Linux suicide.\n\nLinux from scratch - If you want to build your own distro with this then sure go ahead.\n\nHopefully this guide has helped you, have fun using Linux!",

    "body": "Hey!\n\nEveryone is excited about the market growth Linux is experiencing after the end of support for Windows 10. Unlike many other beginners here, I didn't want to switch to Windows 11 and decided to go with Linux Mint instead. I tried it out for about four weeks before deciding to install something else. I liked the customization options and simplicity of Linux Mint, but when I looked at Reddit and saw many of these KDE desktops, my envy grew and I installed Arch (by the way) using the Archinstall script. \n\nBoth Linux Mint and Arch Linux were easy to install, and with the Archinstall script, I would say that installing Arch Linux is almost as easy as installing Linux Mint. \n\nAs I scrolled through Reddit (again), watched YouTube, and read comments on news sites, I came across a statement that prevails on social media regarding Linux: it's not beginner-friendly! And although I'm still very new to Linux, I wondered if that's really the case and if that statement might simply be wrong. \n\n  \nWhat exactly is not beginner-friendly when it comes to installing Linux? I don't think it's Linux itself, but rather that installing a new operating system in general is not beginner-friendly. You have to set up things that are not commonplace for a normal desktop user. Create a bootable USB stick with the operating system... Access the BIOS. Boot from the BIOS. Everything you have to do when installing a new Windows system. With a little experience, these steps sound ridiculous, but when installing Linux, I formatted my USB stick for the first time, dealt with partitions, and only occasionally entered my BIOS. So I was very nervous myself.\n\nBut after that, Linux (even Arch Linux) works like a charm. I would personally describe myself as an average desktop user. I play a few games, work in the office, develop and design games, but nothing really specific or anything that I would say, “That's crazy!” And for me, Linux works just like Windows, except that I have to enter some terminal commands that I Googled to install a few things. \n\nI use the terminal all the time because I love it, I really love it, but it's not necessary because you can download everything you need via a GUI or the website.\n\nSo is the statement “Linux is not beginner-friendly” simply wrong, and it's actually about installing an operating system that has nothing to do with Linux or any other operating system?

Sure, given time and a bit of effort, all of those things are possible, but quite a few of the things he did in the video are NOT beginner things, and certainly not just 5 minutes of googling.  The thing that doesn't add up is him calling himself \"not a technical guy\" and then going ahead with a notoriously hard distro and doing a bunch of things that are arguably things that takes effort.\n\nLastly, I do fear that he did the Linux community a disfavor by basically promoting Arch linux, despite his disclaimers and explanation that it is a difficult to use distro, to non-technical people.....

A dog's vomit pile of USB flash drives is hardly the most efficient, the most practical, the most technically advanced, or the most professionally-looking way of promoting the practice. I prefer it this way because its intersection between the cost, the redundancy and the predictable simplicity vectors best suits my current needs. ...and of course it's nuts.\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* Ventoy?** It's a bootable container for live-medium disk images, or actual distro installers, that saves a user from having to flash those same disk images on separate removable media, like USB flash drives or CD-ROMs. As for actually fully installing those distros inside the storage Ventoy partition, like I've otherwise done on these USB flash drives, I'm not sure that it's its intended purpose. I didn't think that the qualification I made in my original post, in the phrase '*have actual distro installations*' was so hard to miss.\n\nAs for all the other suggested containerization and virtualization solutions? Before leaving Windows altogether, years ago, I remember trying one of the mainstream distros within Windows' Virtualbox, and I found out the hard way that the hardware connectivity translation a VM implements can sometimes hide actual hardware incompatibilities that are then laid bare ...on bare-metal installations. Proxmox? Yeah, Linux is that versatile that it excels equally on servers and end-user machines alike, but I didn't want to go to that level of technical complexity just to test drive distros, when I don't need to. To use a bunch of USB flash drives for distro hopping is an irreverent homage to the kind of experimenting that otherwise is viewed differently by those not yet familiar with what Linux can offer. Let's all take it as being just that, shall we.",

    "title": "Still on Windows 7? Don't want Windows 10? Consider switching to Linux (and specifically, Ubuntu). A Guide.",
    "body": "**Any actions taken as part of this guide are solely at your own risk - unfortunately there is no way to account for every hardware configuration or error that may potentially crop up. BACK UP YOUR CRITICAL DATA BEFORE DOING ANYTHING**\n\nOn the 14th Jan 2020, official Windows 7 support ends for most users. This means if you run Windows 7 beyond that date, you're no longer going to receive security and system updates, which will leave you increasingly vulnerable to viruses, malware and system failure. Depending on how critical your data is and how often you back up - if at all - there's a potential you can lose everything.\n\nThis is a somewhat opinionated but no-bullshit guide for those of you still on Windows 7 who really don't want or won't move to Windows 10. Aside from my own additions, it's going to reference a lot of great guides and advice written by other people, but conveniently collected in a single place. It's crazy, but it might just work. \n\nHave you considered... Linux? Specifically, Ubuntu.\n\nNo, hear me out. Because I'm going to start (and save you a lot of time) by telling you why you SHOULDN'T switch to Linux. If any of the criteria listed apply, then:\n  \n* [Switch to Windows 10 while you can still get a \"free upgrade\" using your Windows 7 key](https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-how-you-can-still-get-a-free-windows-10-upgrade/). You can even use it as an excuse to justify that machine upgrade you've been wanting the past couple of years!\n* Keep your Windows 7 machine and disconnect it from the Internet and all networks forever unless you want to get owned and lose everything dear to you in the next couple of months or so.\n* Buy a Mac. \n\nThe guide is broken into the following sections, if you want to jump to the points that are relevant. If you want to get straight to it, go to (4):\n\n1. Why shouldn't I go with Linux?\n2. Why should I go with Linux?\n3. Why Ubuntu?\n4. What's involved in switching?\n5. Installation of Ubuntu\n6. Tips for new users using Ubuntu\n7. Gaming on Linux\n8. Alternative Software\n9. TL;DR or The Conclusion\n10. To do list for the guide\n\n# 1. Why shouldn't I go with Linux?\n------------------\nIf you:\n\n* Don't feel comfortable installing an operating system and you don't have someone that can do it for you;\n* Have someone that helps you with all your IT-related activities who is not familiar with or dislikes Linux (ask them);\n* Are big into multiplayer games. (There are exceptions here, discussed in more detail in the Linux Gaming section);\n* Use multiple game clients and have a lot of games on platforms other than Steam;\n* Are into any sort of VR;\n* Absolutely need Outlook and refuse to consider any other mail client, like Thunderbird;\n* Use a VPN provider that doesn't have a Linux version and aren't willing/able to change;\n* Are subscribed to multiple video streaming services other than Netflix and watch these on your PC frequently;\n* Use Photoshop, Premiere, 3D Studio Max - actually, if you have any Windows software that you are locked into due to muscle memory, experience and/or professional requirements and that have no Linux version. (There are, however, often a Linux *alternatives* for a lot of these);\n* Require assistive technologies, such as screenreaders. While [Ubuntu comes with several built-in assistive tools](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Accessibility), there's a lot of specialised assistive use cases, tools and hardware that don't work on Linux and have no comparable alternative;\n* Want to be able to buy whatever piece of hardware that takes your fancy without researching it and expect them to work out the box with zero hassle. Especially niche and specific hardware like flight controllers, sound boards and so on;\n* Use iTunes extensively for your media library and/or interacting with your iPhone;\n* Have a large archive of Microsoft Office documents that use complex formatting, macros and/or formulas that you refer back to frequently.\n* **have the worst-case scenario: rely on legacy or ancient software or hardware you're not sure you have the installation media for anymore, can't find a replacement, can't download it and it doesn't work on Windows 10. In this case, you're going to have to keep that Windows 7 box around and it's even more imperative that you make sure it's not accessible from the web or network. Start looking at moving to a more modern equivalent of it AND converting your work to a format that'll be accessible.** \n\nSome of this stuff you can work around with some effort, but it's more likely going to be more trouble than you're willing to put up with. And that's fine; Linux can't help everyone. The more of these that apply, the more certain you can be that you shouldn't consider Linux and should just go with Windows 10, unless you're willing to ~sacrifice~ compromise.\n\n# 2. Why should I go with Linux?\n------------\n\nBecause whether you're a general user, a gamer or a specialised user with niche interests or requirements, Linux can provide you the same experience you're getting now with some already stated exceptions. In many ways, it's better - it's free, it's generally runs better on older hardware than Windows, it's relatively more secure due to a small user footprint and you'll have a huge, vetted library of free software that you can access. There are some applications - older Windows software and games, for instance - that don't work on Windows 10 but do on Linux, thanks to projects like Wine and Proton. It can 99% of the time update itself without interrupting whatever you're doing.\n\nThat being said, it's not perfect. You will lose some things. You will need to learn new ways of working with your PC. This is inevitable. That's the cost of switching.\n\nWhich is not to say Windows is without a cost. Unlike Windows, none of this functionality comes at the cost of your privacy and freedom. Linux will let you configure it as you like, and dive into the nitty-gritty settings to fine-tune it further. It will [not try and trick you into creating yet another online account to use it](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/microsoft-hides-windows-10-offline-account,40506.html). Aside from a few missteps ([Ubuntu and Amazon](https://www.howtogeek.com/126995/how-to-disable-the-amazon-search-ads-in-ubuntus-unity-dash/), for one), it keeps its nose out of your business. It does not come with a [unique advertising ID](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4459081/windows-10-general-privacy-settings) that links your multitude of online and offline interests and programs into a nice, tidy, profitable pack of data to be shared with \"trusted third-parties\". It does not serve you ads in a product you paid for. It does not try and push you into multiple online services. \n\nIn short, it does not suffer from any of the privacy concerns of Windows' future.\n\nNow, I know people are going to throw snark about lead-and-tin alloys, their pliability and how easy that makes it to fashion headgear, but please note I said \"future\"; while they're not necessarily prying now, your operating system - and for almost everyone, that means Microsoft - has a very privileged position in your life as far as personal data is concerned. Any time you search in the file manager, every word you write and document you save, your budget calculations, every photo you view and program you use, every voice command you give Cortana, Windows - and by extension Microsoft - knows about. And there's nothing in their Terms of Service that *stop* them from starting to collect more detailed data if they so choose.\n\nIt's not a question of whether you prefer Windows 7 over 10 - Windows 7 got the same telemetry features as Windows 10 ages ago. Rather, ask yourself if you're happy with Microsoft's evolving business model, one that is shifting more and more of your content online and is intricately and opaquely tied to your personal data? If you're not, you're not alone: [Holland isn't happy](https://www.bit-tech.net/news/tech/software/dutch-dpa-opens-privacy-investigation-into-windows-10/1/). [Germany's not too thrilled either](https://thenextweb.com/privacy/2019/07/15/german-schools-ban-microsoft-office-365-amid-privacy-concerns/). There are legitimate reasons to be wary of Window's market dominance and increased level of embedded user analytics. Linux offers you an alternative.\n\n# 3. Why Ubuntu?\n-------------\nUbuntu LTS is by far the most commonly used desktop Linux distro and the one with the widest support by software developers and hardware manufacturers involved in Linux. If you're searching for solutions, you'll mostly find Ubuntu ones. Lastly, Ubuntu's LTS versions are supported for long periods of time: 18.04, which we'll be recommending, is supported until 2023, while the next version coming out in April, Ubuntu 20.04, will be supported until 2025.\n\nOne of the things you'll quickly learn about the Linux community is that someone will ALWAYS suggest a different Linux distro. In this case, it'll probably be [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/), which aims to be a newbie-friendly Linux. It's based on Ubuntu, is similar to Windows 7 and will MOSTLY work the same as Ubuntu. I still suggest Ubuntu, but whatever, follow your heart.\n\nTo keep this guide as approachable as possible, and to have access to the widest range of help and support, I decided to focus on Ubuntu. Anything other than these two and you're just making things harder for yourself as a new user. You can always switch once you get a feel for how things work.\n\n# 4. What's involved in switching?\n------------------\n\nI promised you a no-bullshit guide, so I'm going to cut straight to it. Take your time with all of these steps, do them properly, and you shouldn't have a problem.\n\nFirst step: back up all your important documents, photos, email, games - whatever is important to you, and preferably somewhere external to your machine. This is just good advice regardless of whether you're switching to Linux or not. *Always have a backup.*\n\nIf you're a gamer, check out the [following guide by PC Gamer's Jarred Walton on how to back up your games across multiple clients.] (https://www.pcgamer.com/how-to-transfer-game-files-between-pcs/)\n\nWhile you're backing up, [install Thunderbird (Mozilla's open-source mail client)](https://www.thunderbird.net/) and copy your mail over to it. You'll have a much easier time doing this in Windows than in Linux to start. Thunderbird can automatically pull your mail from Outlook if installed on the same machine. Then [follow the steps here](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data) for backing up your Thunderbird profile. You'll restore this in Linux later. Make sure you have your mail account details. \n\nGet hold of your Windows 7 serial key. If it's physical media, like a DVD, then check and make sure the key is in the box or on the disc. If it's a laptop that came with Windows 7 preinstalled, it's usually a sticker on the specific laptop. You'll need this if things go awry and/or decide Linux is not for you.\n\nCheck [the minimum specs for Ubuntu 18.04.03 here](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop). If your system doesn't meet them, you're going to have a bad time regardless of whether you go with Ubuntu or Windows 10 ([Windows 10 minimum requirements](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028142/windows-10-system-requirements) are bullshit, btw. 1Gb Ram, 1Ghz processor? I challenge anyone to link me to a Windows 10 video running on those specs where it performs acceptably.). There are lightweight alternatives if you can't afford a new PC, (Lubuntu, for instance), but upgrading your PC should be your first step in this case.\n\nHere comes the arduous bit. Make a list of your current hardware, software and services that you use frequently, make sure you have the installation media for the critical pieces of software you use (Don't expect to be able to just copy/paste the applications you have) and do a search on whether they run on Linux. I'd recommend following the \"Software\" section in this guide on [Migrating to Linux](https://old.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/edaq0s/guide_migrating_to_linux_in_2020/) by /u/PBLKGodofGrunts]\n\nA lot of the Linux software alternatives, such as LibreOffice and GIMP, are available for Windows as well. Consider downloading those that interest you to try out in Windows and get a feel for how they work. \n\nUltimately, to echo the advice you'll find that you can either run it, have an alternative or just can't switch. That's okay; Linux can't help everyone.\n\nDownload [the Ubuntu LTS 18.04.03 distro](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop). The \"LTS\" means it's a long-term support version - you won't have to think about this exercise for the next three years if you're lucky. Ubuntu LTS 20.04 is coming out in four months, which'll be supported until 2025, but since most of the focus is still on 18.04, you're better off sticking with it for now.\n\nWhichever you choose, you'll have to write it to a DVD or USB. If it's a DVD, use whatever you normally use to write DVD ISOs. If you're going to use a USB, [here's a guide to doing that.](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#0)\n\nDid I mention to back-up your important data? Back-up your important data. Double-check that it's all there. If you want to take an extra precaution, you [can use Clonezilla to clone your current OS drive](https://www.clonezilla.org/). It's not necessary, but if things go bust, Clonezilla allows you to restore your PC to precisely the way it was before you started without needing to install Windows from scratch. However, Clonezilla can be a bit daunting if you're not technically inclined. Check out this [somewhat out-of-date video by cButters Tech for a general idea of what's involved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JflYnwe8cTE).\n\nLastly, try running Ubuntu as a Live CD/USB first. This will allow you to run Ubuntu as if it were installed, but without making any changes to your current installation. Please keep in mind that the Live is not indicative of performance... it will run slower than if it was installed, as it has to read everything off the DVD or USB stick first and load it memory. The important thing to check here is that it's picking up all your hardware, that it's displaying on your screen correctly, that all your drives are available, and so on.\n\nLive USB should perform better than a Live DVD. Check out the \"Okay, it's installed/Okay, I'm running the Live CD. What tips do you have for using Ubuntu?\" section to get an idea of what you should be checking.\n\n# 5. Installation.\n-----------------\n\nYou've done all the above, triple-checked your backups and either decided that you can't make the jump or you're ready. \n\nHowever, before you begin installing, you have one last decision to make.\n\nThere's a lot people that suggest dual-booting - that's where you keep Windows around and just install Linux alongside it. This is often proposed as a safety net and a means for people to have the best of both worlds. I don't, for a couple of reasons:\n\n* If you are going to dual-boot, you'll need to update to Windows 10 anyway, and if you're going to do that, why bother with Linux in the first place?\n\n* Data will be spread between two operating systems. Instead of backing up and maintaining one OS, you'll be maintaining two. It's doable but a PITA.\n\n* You're sabotaging your efforts, and your switch to Linux will likely fail. That's not a statement on Linux's capability or ease of use. A lot of things are easier on Linux - but they won't be at first. You probably have years of Windows use ingrained in you; you've come to expect things to work they way Windows works. That's not ease, that's familiarity; that's a boiling frog. And the moment something throws you a challenge in Linux, the temptation to just \"do it\" in Windows will be too great. And the more you do that, the more running Linux will seem like a chore than a choice.\n\n* If you absolutely have no option but to run Windows 10, do it in a virtual machine - you get the benefits of dual-booting but with the bonus of limiting Windows 10 to a virtual environment where access to the rest of your system (and personal data) is restricted while allowing you to run your non-negotiable applications (other than games or any intense 3D applications) just fine.\n\nIf you decide to dual-boot, you'll need to find a recent guide that covers this. Typically, it's best to update to Windows 10 first, then follow the guide to dual-boot Ubuntu. None of the guides I found seemed good for beginners, so I'm willing to take suggestions from the comments.\n\nIf you take my advice and simply dive in, installing Ubuntu on your machine will be a painless process: [just follow the steps here in a beginner's guide written by Jason Evangelho and you should be fine.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2018/08/29/beginners-guide-how-to-install-ubuntu-linux/)\n\n# 6. Tips for new users using Ubuntu?\n------------------\n\nThings that you should do only once Ubuntu's installed are prefixed with an [+]. Otherwise, the tip applies to both installs and Live demos:\n\n* Power off, log-out and running taskbar applications will be in the top-right of the screen by default.\n* To search, press the Windows key on your keyboard. This'll bring up Ubuntu's search bar. You can use this to find applications, folders and system settings.\n* In the File Manager, your Home directory will be where your primary OS and applications will typically be installed, while the Other Locations will list additional hard drives (usually your additional storage drives). By default, Ubuntu does not actually mount the drives in the \"Other Locations\" section. Clicking on any of them, however, will automatically mount them. If you want to learn more about the general structure of Ubuntu's file system, [you can do so here](http://www.linuxandubuntu.com/home/the-linux-file-system-structure-explained).\n* Ctrl+Alt+T will bring up the terminal. The terminal is where you'll often be sent if you're attempting to diagnose a problem, perform specific tasks or install specific tools/software. Check yourself before your wreck yourself before copy-pasting commands from strangers on the 'net. Be super cautious of any command that involves \"sudo\" and \"rm\".\n* The default office suite for Ubuntu is LibreOffice. Try it out: see if you can open a couple of your documents, like spreadsheets and Word docs. You might be pleasantly surprised. Writer is the word processor, Calc is for Spreadsheets. Formating on complex documents will likely be broken. Don't save any of these at this point. \n* In fact, open up a couple of common files you normally use - images, documents, compressed files, music, videos and so on. Get a feel for how it works, what opens and what doesn't. Sometimes, you'll need to install some software first before it will work.\n* Check the list of alternative software for some suggestions on what to install if you seem to be missing something.\n* Plug in your phone and see if it detects it and you can access your files. If it's Android, you should be fine.\n* You'll notice that some commands - like updating - require you to enter your password again. This is a security feature similar to when Windows ask you to run a program as administrator or with elevated privileges. If you didn't initiate the command that brought up the password request, be cautious about entering it in.\n* [+] Change your desktop preferences and move the application bar to the bottom of the screen. By default, Ubuntu puts it on the left-side. Hey, maybe you'll like it like that! This was the one Windows habit I was never able to shake.\n* [+] Try and store your data in the pre-defined folders (Music, Videos, Documents, Pictures). You don't have to, but you'll make your life a lot easier doing so.\n* [+] Search for and create a shortcut to the Software Updater. This allows you to quickly check for and install Ubuntu updates.\n* [+] Likewise, create a shortcut to the Ubuntu Software Centre. To start with, you'll want to stick to installing applications from the Centre. These have been specifically tested to work on Ubuntu and will 99% run without a hitch. You'll be able to remove applications from here as well.\n* [+] Speaking of the Centre, Ubuntu comes preinstalled with an Amazon launcher. Use this time search for it and remove it. Or don't, it's up to you.\n* [+] Sometimes, you'll see there's two versions of a piece of software in the Centre. This is most likely due to there being a Snap version of it. Snaps are self-contained versions of the software that are usually the most up-to-date; however, they can run erratically or not have access to some things on your system, like fonts. I'd stick with the ubuntu-bionic versions for best compatibility.\n* [+] If you're a gamer, change your graphic drivers so you can get reasonable performance. For Nvidia, simply search for the Software &amp; Updates application, open it, select the Additional Drivers Tab, and [check whether you're using the Nvidia Driver](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2019/07/install-nvidia-driver-update-ubuntu-its). You'll want to select the one that's listed as proprietary and tested. AMD's a little more complicated and I profess to having little experience with it. I'll happily take advice from the comments in this instance.\n* [+] When downloading some games or applications specifically for Linux, you'll often get a .Deb file or a script. A deb file can often be run as is by double-clicking in Ubuntu; you can read more about them [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_%28file_format%29). Scripts often need to be run from the terminal and made to be executable. [You read more about that here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/38661/how-do-i-run-sh-scripts). Again, same safety check applies to running anything you download from the web.\n\n# 7. Gaming on Linux\n--------------\n\nIf you're a gamer, I'd recommend [the following the guide by /u/PBLKGodofGrunts](https://old.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/edaq0s/guide_migrating_to_linux_in_2020/) on the /r/linux_gaming subbreddit. But to summarise...\n\n##The Good News\nThanks to Valve's involvement in Linux through Proton and the efforts of the Wine team, Linux gaming has never been better. It's now possible to play many Windows-only games with no hassle and minimal performance loss. Just a few examples of recent games that run just fine on Linux are the Resident Evil 2 remake, Sekiro, Halo: Master Chief Collection (single-player and custom multiplayer games), DOOM, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Risk of Rain 2, Total War: Three Kingdoms, and more; you can even toss a coin to all of your Witchers. To get an idea of games that run on Linux, you can visit [ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com), [Wine AppDB](https://appdb.winehq.org/) or [Lutris](https://www.lutris.net) and search for your desired game. If you're primarily a single-player gamer, the transition should be mostly painless.\n\nAnother amazing development is the number of open-source implementations of older games game engines that allow for playing of classic and retro titles on modern hardware, (such as [DevilutionX for Diablo 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/ei7h2p/devilutionx_an_opensource_diablo_1_replacement/))often with improvements, bug fixes and quality of life improvements, ensuring they'll be able to run into the future. \n\nHowever, the most critical development is that the number of developers and platforms that provide and support native Linux games has increased significantly. [Feral Interactive](https://www.feralinteractive.com/en/) publishes several AAA Linux ports, numerous indies now provide a Linux version, and store fronts like [GOG](https://www.gog.com/) and [itch.io](https://itch.io/) provide an alternative with DRM-free games. \n\n##The Bad News\n\nDespite all of this, gaming remains one of the biggest hurdles to adopting Linux.\n\nIf you're into multiplayer gaming, you're out of luck. While many multiplayer titles do work on Linux (LoL, Dota 2, CS:GO, TF2, Rocket League, Warframe, Overwatch, Starcraft II, World of Warcraft, Eve Online, Elite: Dangerous, Monster Hunter:World and so on), many more don't - Fortnite, some Call of Duties, Apex Legends, PUBG, Battlefield, GTA Online. Essentially, anything with an anti-cheat is likely NOT going to work, and there's always the risk that playing a Windows multiplayer game will get you banned due to anti-cheat measures that dislike any whiff of Linux. My suggestion is check which games you play and go from there.\n \nUnless you're using Steam, running other launchers is complicated and prone to constant breakage without continuous effort and maintenance. Epic, Origin, Uplay and GOG Galaxy can all run on Linux with some effort. Lutris does sort most of these out, but you'll need to follow the [instructions here](https://lutris.net/downloads/), which means your going to have to [install Wine first](https://wiki.winehq.org/Ubuntu).\n\nSome games simply don't work, and there's no solution for it. \n\nSome of the latest developments aren't going to be available to you. VR is tiny on Linux, and you'll likely lose access to most of your VR software and experiences.\n\nDespite being fairly technical already, many gamers do expect things to \"just work\". Here's a list of things that require some effort to get working correctly:\n\n* Super-sampling is out. Not entirely, but it's more complicated than Windows.\n* Access to things like custom shaders and injectors are also going to be limited. Mods can be more complicated or, in some cases, not available.\n* You'll lose some of the benefits of your Gsync/Freesync monitors, since the two tech don't work that well on Ubuntu's standard display compositor. This will change once Ubuntu shifts to Wayland. \n* Things like community game patches are often aimed at Windows, with no Linux alternative.\n\nMost importantly, AMD and Nvidia graphic cards are handled very differently on Linux when compared to Windows. Ubuntu uses an open-source driver by default - this is alright for general use but terrible for games and 3D applications. To get decent performance, you'll need to install their respective drivers.\n\nNvidia's latest Linux drivers are made available in Ubuntu directly. However, this is just the drivers: Nvidia's GeForce Experience isn't available on Linux and you're going to lose access to all of its tools. That means no Ansel in many cases, no DSR, no predefined gaming configs and no ShadowPlay (Although OBS offers a decent alternative in this case). See the Tips section above on how to install it. On the plus side, the installation process is a breeze and Nvidia's performance is fairly solid.\n\nAMD benefits from much better open-source drivers and active support from AMD, but unfortunately suffers from delays for support of their most recent cards and a fairly complicated install process . AMD uses the MESA Driver, combined with Valve's ACO shader compiler, to deliver performance boosts. Installing these drivers can be a complicated, multi-step process. I'm sorry I can't help you on this; I'll happily take someone's advice on getting this working in Ubuntu LTS and include it in the guide.\n\n# 8. Alternative software\n---------------\n\nThis is a quick and dirty guide to equivalent software for Windows applications in Linux. \n\n* Antivirus software: This may seem counterintuitive, but for the most part Linux does not require any sort of anti-virus software. While viruses for Linux exist, the number of viruses and such that target the Linux desktop specifically is tiny compared to Windows. [You can read up about it here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_malware). That being said, if you are concerned there are several tools available for detecting both Windows and Linux malware on the same page. Follow good internet hygiene, don't open suspicious links/mails and think before just randomly following command instructions on the 'net.\n* Microsoft Office: [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/). Or you can access Office365 online. \n* Adobe Photoshop: [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), [Krita](https://krita.org/)\n* Adobe Premiere: [Blender](https://www.blender.org)\n* 3D Studio Max: Blender\n* Illustrator/CorelDraw: [Inkscape](https://www.inkscape.org)\n* Xsplit: [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)\n* Windows Media Player: [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)\n* Basic Audio Editor: [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)\n* Audio Mixing: [Ardour](https://ardour.org/), [Mixbus](https://harrisonconsoles.com/site/mixbus.html)\n* Adobe Reader: While there are several PDF readers on Linux you can use, almost none of them play well with Adobe PDFs with advanced features. You're better off sticking with what comes with Ubuntu, and if it doesn't work, open it up in a browser.\n\n# 9. TL;DR or The Conclusion\n------------\n\nSwitching to Ubuntu is possible and relatively safe if you do some research on which apps/games/software/hardware you use will and won't work on Linux first, you BACK UP YOUR IMPORTANT DATA before doing anything and don't expect a 1:1 experience with Windows. It's all dependent on your flexibility, technical experience and willingness to learn and compromise.\n\nIf you're not, Windows 10 is a perfectly acceptable choice to upgrade to: you'll benefit from improved security compared to Windows 7, a larger selection of hardware and software and will have to put less effort to make everything work at the cost of your privacy and some ads.\n\nIf you have legacy software or unsupported hardware that doesn't run on either, you're kind of screwed. I'd keep the Windows 7 box around, make sure it's disconnected from all networks (for your sake as well as others) and start making emergency contingency plans to find a modern alternative.\n\nI know that people are going to take issue with some of the difficulties I raised, and suggest they're really not dealbreakers. Before you post, consider whether a new user coming from Windows 7 who'll be using Linux probably for the first time in their life will have the knowledge, gumption and willingness to perform sometimes complex technical steps in an operating environment they're unfamiliar with and where it's much, much easier to really break things.\n\nFeel free to post criticisms and suggestions in the comments. If there's some good advice worth including, something needs further clarification or I need to correct something, I'll edit it in with credit.\n\n# 10. To do list for the guide\n-------------\n\n* I'd really like to add a section on assistive technology and software that works on Linux, but as I don't use any of it, I feel my research would be limited and miss vital pieces. If you have advice on this, let me know.\n* A good, up-to-date and easy-to-follow guide for dual-booting.\n* Instructions on how to install AMD drivers correctly on Ubuntu.",

    "body": "I switched myself to linux a while ago, mainly for enthusiasm and wanting to try something new, and ended up realising how bad windows has become in the process, i'm no expert but here's what i learned:\n\n1.What is linux, and what's a distribution?\n\n -Linux is actually just a kernel (the core of an operating system), so When we usually say \"Linux\" we mean GNU/Linux, GNU is a set of open source tools necessary for any modern operating system.\n \n-A Linux distribution, is a version of that GNU+Linux implementation, each distro with some tweaks, perks and features.\n\n2. Why should you switch in the first place?\n\n -Security and transparency, no company is gonna dare bundle spyware on their distro. Since everything is open source, even users can get the source code and take a look at what the company is doing and even modify the distro.\nAlso, linux has generally less malware made for it.\n \n-Its free and lightweight, Windows 11 requires 64GB of storage to install, and at least 4GB of ram. Whereas ZorinOS for example, requires 15GB of storage and 1.5GB of ram.\n\n-Its resource efficient, that's why in many game titles, Linux outperforms Windows 11 despite having to run a translation layer and having worse driver support.\n\n -Extremely customizable, you can customize any aspect of your OS, literally.\n\n -Open source software is awesome, trust me bro.\n\n3. Things to consider:\n\n -While game and app support is improving, and translation layers like Wine and Proton exist, some apps and games just won't run, including Photoshop, fortnite and Valorant. There's an alternative for everything tho (like GIMP for Photoshop).\n \n -You will have to learn and get used to a few things in linux, like the terminal (used to control &amp; perform operations using commands).\n\n-There are around 600 distributions currently maintanted, so its important to choose the right one for you, there are also different distribution families, the most popular of which is Debian and its derivatives, so if you are new to linux go with Ubuntu, ZorinOS or mint (the 3 are Debian based). There are also distros made specifically for gaming like Nobara or steamOS.\n\n-You can try a linux distro without installing it, using a live USB drive.\n\n-Nvidia drivers aren't up there yet for linux, so you might get a slightly worse performance in games with Nvidia GPUs.\n\n\nI hope this helps, please correct me if i'm wrong.",

    "body": "I'm a regular contributor to this forum, and I try my best to help those in need of help, on their journey into the Linux universe, but as Windows 10's end draws nearer, more and more people are faced with the stark choice of either having to fork out a shit load of money for absolutely no good reason other than to buy new machines, just because Microsoft is not letting them upgrade to Windows 11 on their existing ones, or having to flee the Windows universe, and migrate to Linux.\n\nHowever, Microsoft's greatest evil is to have forced consumers for so long into taking up Windows, simply because computer retailers don't sell computers from mainstream OEM's that have anything else other than Windows on them. At least Apple makes its own toys, and puts its own OS *only* on its own toys.\n\nAnd as Windows 10's D-Day draws nearer, I get to read questions from its refugees that simply highlights the troubling epidemic of absent curiosity. More often than not, I get to see questions from people that need way too much hand-holding, simply because Microsoft, in its haste to protect vapidly parasitic corporate greed, has kept Windows users from maintaining their curiosity in working order, only to have it atrophied to the point where even basic online research skills are missing.\n\nI migrated to the Linux universe well before Windows 10 reared up its ugly head, and yes, being rather tech-savvy (the last desktop PC that I bought 'off-the-shelf' was more than 20 years ago because I've only assembled my own machines ever since) had a lot to do with my contempt towards Microsoft and the way its toxic presence was depriving the world of its freedom of choice, as well as any reasons to remain curious.\n\nFor all those who've never seen anything else, or known anything else other than Windows, believe it or not, there was a time when computers didn't automatically come with an OS already installed on them, let alone only what Microsoft shoved down people's throats. And there was a time when other OS makers ran rings around MS.\n\nIt's time for the world to turn a corner and rediscover a world of computing free of Windows and its suffocating dominance.\n\nEDIT: I took to Linux not because it was free, as in no up-front payments, but because it's collaborative open-source premise meant that there was nothing hidden from the end users, and the thousands of coders and maintainers encouraged you, the person at the other end of the equation, to learn and share their creations openly, which invariably meant that you, the end user, by using what they've created, contributed to their on-the-field-testing part, so that if any problems crop up, they could fix it as soon as they knew of it.\n\nThat's why Linux is worth your time and your efforts to learn it. It's time to let your inner childhood-like curiosity to get you to start asking yourself \"I wonder what happens if I do this...\" more often.",

Somewhere between a state of shock and bliss now. I don't even know what Reddit gold does but thank you so much man.\n\nSome points of interest:\n\nDon't bother fanboying over your favourite distro too hard. It won't take long before the next Linux device enters your household and decides to mess with your head by supporting every distro under the sun *except* your favourite one. Think about it this way: Having access to multiple distributions, all catered to different situations, is *way* more of a feature than any Windows system could ever hope to achieve.\n\nNo seriously Arch fanboys it's time to calm down, I love Arch as much as the next basement dweller but if you stare blindly into the light all it will do is burn out your eyes. What would you do if Arch suddenly disappeared? Install Void Linux and cry on their forums how everything isn't Arch? Like Windows users do on Linux forums? Because they are stuck in their ways? Notice a pattern? Man I talk in too many condescending questions.\n\nThe only reason I mentioned Emacs over Vim is because Emacs has superior support in graphical environments, sorry Vim fanboys. Again in 2018 it really won't matter that much because both have large enough bases of support. Whichever gets the job done in the *best way possible for you* is the one you should go for. You should be enhancing your workflow in whatever way is productive to you.\n\n**Okay back to mindless bullet listing:**\n\n* Ever seen the [Android root folder?](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LsRUE.png) Obviously you'll need to be rooted to access it, but once you are [you can use any file explorer with root access](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nextapp.fx&amp;hl=en) to browse through it. Not really practical, but it might be neat.\n* You'll probably learn about this early on but I'm still surprised that [Samba](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/samba) is now the bees knees when it comes to file sharing, despite originally coming from windows. [There's NFS too](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NFS) but people will shout at you for using an non-encrypted protocol.

    "body": "tl;dr Dont recommend arch to new people comers, pretty please? People who like the arch way, will find their way there eventually for sure. Arch people, Why do you hate linux? Why dont you want it to become more wide-spread?\n\n---\n\nArch approach is 'you either learn to swim or you die' is fucking stupid **FOR NOOBS**\n\nWhen you learn math, you first learn addition, then subtraction, then multiplication, then division, then the harder stuff\n\nYou learn to walk, then to run\n\nThats how you learn everything else. Why cant you see this is not a good way to learn linux either?\n\nI used to think linux was hard and failed to make the switch a few times. Just because i thought linux was too hard and time consuming for me... :(\n\nNow that i know a lot about linux, i think thats really not true at all. I managed to have everybody around me using ubuntu and, most difficult, to like it. (Disclaimer: i dont use ubuntu myself)\n\n95% of all distros are made of the same stuff. Starting with something hard is fucking retarded and we have here only stories of the people who survived instead of the stories of the people going back to windows because they thought linux was hard\n\nArch is survivor bias at its peak of stupidity. I swear to god that new comers that overcome the barrier reach peak stupidity and tries to infect others with their disease like they have become enlightened\n\nI like to fiddle **a lot** in linux. Its great compared with windows. But I like to do this with a few packages i care about. The rest, i just want them to work. This is true for the vast majority. Specially new people starting\n\nYou can have everything working and learn one package the same in any distro, all while having the rest of you distro working. Arch is not special in that way at all. You learn in small bits at your own pace and you are not REQUIRED to learn something\n\nYou can even use the arch wiki to learn while in other distro\n\nWhy arch is not good for new comers:\n\n * By design, they touch upstream the least amount. A good distro will remove things from upstream that are bad for the user. The user is the priority, not the developer\n * This also implies that things are not standarized either. A good distro will try to make everything homogeneous and work in a similar fashion even if they come from different sources. Again by design. It creates expectations on the users. In Arch you will have to learn upstream of every package\n * AUR is not fucking curated. Yes, malware is found there from time to time\n * New comers come from windows, not to from other linux distro. If they fail to make the switch, they come back to windows\n * They are memeing arch to make it appealing to people that dont know better. In a way, it feels they are being tricked. And i dont really like when people is taken advantage of\n\nPlease, instead of installing arch because you are memed into it, read their [principles](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux#Principles) to see if they appeal to you\n\nPS:\n\nI acknowledge that people that uses arch linux like to learn about linux and that as a whole is great, but i wont sacrifice a potential new linux user that just uses it and chill just in the off case they might enjoy more the 'swim or die' arch way\n\nI also acknowledge that this particular style is good for a few people, but not for the majority of people",

    "title": "An open letter to Linux noobs regarding Kali Linux.",
    "body": "With alarming frequency I see posts on this subreddit involving relatively basic troubleshooting questions from users running Kali Linux. I wrote this as a response to that. I think Kali Linux is great. I just don't think everybody should be using it as a desktop OS.\n\n**The TL;DR for this post could be taken straight from the [Kali FAQ](http://docs.kali.org/introduction/should-i-use-kali-linux)**: \"If you are unfamiliar with Linux generally, if you do not have at least a basic level of competence in administering a system, if you are looking for a Linux distribution to use as a learning tool to get to know your way around Linux, or if you want a distro that you can use as a general purpose desktop installation, Kali Linux is probably not what you are looking for.\"\n\n*Dear Linux noobs,*\n\nLinux is cool. You're interested in Linux and that makes you cool too. You should be proud of your interest in Linux. You're now part of a community that is full of cool people (OK, a few of us are jerks, but what can you do).\n\nWhat else is cool? Computer hacking. Password cracking. Network penetration. These things are neat, and the people who can do them are usually pretty cool too (though some of them are jerks too). Learning to do these things is fun, and if you want to do it, you should. When practiced responsibly, these things can make fun hobbies, or even a lucrative career. The purpose of this post is not to discourage anybody from learning to do these things.\n\nOne of the major problems new Linux users face when starting out is figuring out which Linux distribution is right for them. There are a lot of options after all. Everybody likes to recommend their favorite distro (and also occasionally give their opinion on their least favorite distro). Very frequently I see questions in this subreddit, and in related subreddits, like \"What distro should I use?\", \"I want to learn to code, what distro would be good for me?\", \"What is the best distro for python programming?\", or \"What distro should I use to learn penetration testing?\". New Linux users who might be interested in penetration testing (or some other related topic) might, by some means or another, discover Kali Linux. They might think \"Hey, I want to learn Linux and also pen-testing! I should use Kali Linux.\" They'd probably be wrong.\n\nThe thing is, most desktop distributions provide access to the same software. If you want to watch Youtube videos and write email, Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora, etc, are all equally capable of that. If you want to learn python programming, you can do that on any of those distributions. Similarly, if you want to learn pen-testing, you can do it from any of those distributions.\n\nKali Linux is a distribution specifically designed to be a toolkit for professional pen-testers. As such, it might be very attractive to new Linux users who are interested in security. However, Kali is /not/ designed as a general purpose Linux distro. Some elements of it's design are simply not suited for use as a general purpose desktop. If you're a new Linux user who installs Kali Linux chances are you will have a frustrating experience. The Kali Linux maintainers even have a FAQ page \"Is Kali Linux right for me?\" \n\nhttp://docs.kali.org/introduction/should-i-use-kali-linux\n\nPlease read that article before deciding to use Kali as a desktop OS, especially if you're new to Linux. If you don't yet understand some of the points made in that article that's probably a sign to avoid Kali for now.\n\nIt's quite often that I see people asking questions like \"How do I do X in Kali Linux?\" or \"[Kali] Y is not working. Please help.\" Unfortunately these users don't usually get the help they need, which makes me sad. The posts are often dismissed or downvoted. Perhaps I'm wrong, but I'd wager that most of the people asking these questions don't need Kali. They need a desktop distribution.\n\nI am worried that if your first adventures with Linux are in Kali you will have a frustrating experience and be turned off from the whole endeavor. Your questions might be dismissed and left unanswered because you appear to be in over your head.\n\n*Using Kali Linux as your first desktop Linux distro is like learning to drive on a racecar. Please don't do it.*\n\nPeace.",

    "body": "First off, I love a lot of things about Linux. The speed, the customization, workspaces are awesome, and I actually love using the terminal. It's so fast and I actually find it fun to navigate using the keyboard, rsync is amazing, and I love writing scripts like my own little mini-programs.\n\nBut it just seems like every single thing I try to do required an hour of Googling and trial &amp; error.\n\nRight off the bat, WiFi didn't work. I scoured the internet and eventually found that if I installed a specific driver and a specific kernel and a specific header then it would all work. Luckily I could USB tether from my phone to get that all done and it worked!\n\nI better make a backup of my system and those drivers and stuff! Pop in a flash drive and nothing happens. Off to Google to learn how to mount it in the terminal. \n\nThen I wanted it to mount my NAS automatically on boot, but I had a lot of problems with it trying and failing to do that before being connected to the network. Again, a TON of searching and trying all kinds of variations in the fstab before I found the right combination of arguments to make it work.\n\nThen the computer would just randomly freeze sometimes. Completely unrecoverable. I couldn't really track this one down so I decided to try a different distro.\n\nRedo all of the stuff I did before on the new distro (which was pretty easy because I had backups) Then after doing all this work I restarted and just got a blaack screen after logging in. Back to Google and I eventually find that with this distro I need to add \"nomodeset\" to grub. Whew, we're back in.\n\nThen I constantly get some popup wanting to connect to an external display that doesn't exist? Back to Google, find some service to shut off to make that go away.\n\nThen I like having Remote Desktop software so that I can control my computer from other computers or my phone. So I install TeamViewer but most of the buttons in the app don't do anything when I click on them, I can't log in. Tried Googling that for a while but couldn't figure it out. So I tried Chrome Remote Desktop instead, get it installed fine but then I get an error message/crash when I connect. More searching and I find some obscure file that I need to create to get that working.\n\nAnd now the last straw is that the brightness controls don't work. I push the function keys on the laptop and the slider pops up on the display and moves but the brightness doesn't change. I've probably spent about 4 hours trying to find a solution to this one but nothing works.\n\nI've been through four distros now because I keep running into different unfixable issues and now this might be the end of this one too.\n\nAgain, I absolutely love the things that work, when they work, but this is just exhausting, I spend all of my time fixing my computer instead of using it.\n\n**TL;DR: Even single little thing I do requires and hour of Googling and trial &amp; error to make work. Does it ever end!?**\n\nEDIT: This subreddit is pretty great. I was honestly expecting to be absolutely crucified for this post; I was scared to check my inbox this morning. But the vast majority of the comments have been supportive/helpful!\n\nI might just keep plugging away at it, maybe I'll take a break and see if I hate going back to Windows.\n\nAhhh who am I kidding? 99% chance I'll just try another distro :p",

But for the most part, it Just Works ™\n\nConky works better than any other distro I've tried (they would all minimise it if I push Super + D, but on Ubuntu it works properly), TeamViewer which for some reason was compeltely broken on other distros just works perfectly without doing anything special. My brightness buttons work just fine (because why wouldn't they!?!?), hell, even my fingerprint sensor works!\n\nNow some things were a bit different and I still had to Google a bunch of stuff. But instead of digging deep and going through tons of trial and error, the answers are easy to find and work on the first try.\n\nNow customization-wise it is definitely much more limited than other KDE-based things, but I would definitely rather struggle with tinkering than struggle with functioning.\n\nThank you so much to everyone that replied to the other thread with their experiences, sympathies, and advice.\n\nMission accomplished, I DO love Linux!",

    "body": "Manjaro has many issues which other Linux distros do not have. For the beginner user, there are several frustrations that they may run into.\n\nHere are some practical reasons why you should not use Manjaro:\n\n * Manjaro holds back Arch packages, but they do not hold back the AUR itself. This means that some AUR packages simply won't work due to incompatible library/packages, and you basically won't be able to do anything. For me this happened with Anbox, and KDE's Mauikit suite of apps, but I'm positive that this issue will occur with other packages. You don't actually get access to the full AUR, just most of it. \n * The AUR helper that they provide, pamac is slow, and it failed to compile packages many times when I used it. However, other AUR helpers I have used (I mainly use yay) are much faster, and they very rarely fail to compile packages.\n * Although Manjaro holds back packages, they don't actually intervene when their is a bug or a similar or a similar issue. And even if they did intervene, any patches made would bring new bugs/issues, and so on. There is no real point to holding back packages, and what they do just makes the system less stable. \n\n\nAnother big thing is that Arch is an entire terminal based, DIY distro, however, Manjaro has a completely opposite philosophy. Manjaro's philosophy is for users to never have to touch the terminal at all, and the clashing of philosophies of the parent distro and the derivative distro creates issues. We can see something similar with Ubuntu and Debian, but Ubuntu handles it much, much better due to the support of a larger company - support which Manjaro lacks. \n\nHere are some links to other articles, in which the authors point out other, more serious issues, such as unfixed security vulnerabilities. \n\nhttps://www.hadet.dev/Manjaro-Bad/\n\nhttps://github.com/arindas/manjarno \n\nThere is no true way to get \"Arch without the pain,\" because philosophy of Arch Linux brings what some users consider to be pain. If you want something close, I recommend EndeavorOS, a reputable and trusted distro with a fairly large community, or Garuda, a new and upcoming distro that has some minor issues but those can easily be overlooked. \n\nI don't recommend any kind of \"Arch installer,\" because by default, Arch does not come with things that many users would consider necessary, like Bluetooth or Printing. Although the Arch Wiki provides guides for setting those things up, if you aren't willing/able read the Arch Wiki in order to actually install Arch, why would you be willing/able to read the Arch Wiki in order to set up Bluetooth or printing? \n\n(Although I will admit that the guides to set up printing and bluetooth were vastly easier compared to the installation guide (couple minutes compared to a couple of hours), my point is still the same. Also, there are many other things the Arch Wiki provides guides to do.)",

I deleted it not long after, but that paranoia stuck with me. I always had this uneasy feeling that some hidden malware might still be lurking in the system.\n\nBecause of that, I avoided logging into any important accounts from that laptop. I just didn’t trust it anymore.\n\nAt one point, I considered reinstalling Windows. Maybe a clean start would help.\n\nBut then reality hit me: Windows 8.1 doesn’t get security updates anymore. That means no patches, no zero-day fixes.. nothing.\n\nAnd switching to Windows 10 or 11 wasn’t a great option either. My laptop’s specs (Celeron N2840, 4GB RAM, and still using HDD) just aren’t built for it.\n\nThat’s when I seriously started looking into Linux.\n\nAfter doing some research, I decided to take the leap: I wiped Windows completely and installed Zorin OS Lite.\n\nWhy Zorin? A few reasons:\n\n- It’s lightweight (it use XFCE desktop).\n\n- It runs shockingly well on older hardware.\n\n- And most importantly: it’s beginner-friendly.\n\nTo my surprise, everything I needed was already there. All the apps I use have Linux versions, and Zorin’s built-in Software Store even had more up-to-date options than I expected.\n\nOn Windows 8.1, I’d already started running into compatibility issues.. more and more apps just wouldn’t support it anymore.\n\nBut here on Linux? My laptop feels alive again.\n\nNow, for the first time in years, I actually feel comfortable logging into important accounts. No more nagging fear of spyware. No more worrying about missing security patches.\n\nJust a clean, fast, open-source OS that respects my privacy.\n\nIf you’re in a similar spot: on an older laptop, stuck with outdated Windows, feeling paranoid like I did, then I highly recommend giving Linux a shot.\n\nIt might just be the best decision you make for your digital peace of mind.",

Volume mixer, sound mixer, new style system settings microphone settings and then old ass control panel microphone settings, app settings, configuration menu, properties menu, menus within properties within configuration within setups and app permissions and on and on and on.. nothing I've done works.

    "body": "You'll often see people proselytizing for modern linux on the internet saying \"you don't have to use the terminal to do anything anymore! :)\"\n\nFor noob friendly distributions like Linux Mint, Ubuntu, etc. *they are right*. You  never have to use the terminal to do anything on your system these days. You can install packages through your software manager. You can back things up through GUI interfaces like timeshift. You can copy files, move files, edit files in GUIs like Nautilus, Nemo, Dolphin, etc. You can change system settings in GUIs. **You don't have to use the terminal to do any of this.**\n\n##So why do you need to know the basics if you don't have to use it?\n\nAs a user of a computer you will hit some problem. You will find something you don't know how to do, some error message you don't understand, some aspect you want to change and can't find the setting for. When that happens you will go to a search engine and start looking up help. That might take you here or to the arch wiki or to some obscure forum or to some clickbait site. \n\nAnd here's the thing; it's difficult to write a guide to fully explain how to fix a problem through the GUI, especially when there's so much variety and customization available on Linux. \n\nTake installing software: one could say,\n\n&gt; \"Ok go to the *Synaptic Software Center* or maybe go to *Ubuntu Software* or maybe click the thing that just says *Software* or maybe go to the *Pop Shop*... ok now find the search bar... it might be a little magnifying glass or maybe just a big white bar... unless you've changed the theme in which case maybe the icon or color is different, ok now search for the program... next click on the right version, no not that one, that's just plugins and not the actual program, ok now click the Install button.. or maybe it's just a little down arrow.\" \n\nor one can say, \n\n&gt;\"open a terminal and type `sudo apt install &lt;program&gt; ` \"\n\nFor this reason almost all *advice*; error fixing, program installing, etc. is terminal based. It skips all the searching through menus to find the right option. It jumps past all the potential differences on each desktop. It's fast, easy and will work if followed exactly. \n\nNow, the terminal is a very fast, powerful and direct way of interacting with your computer. You give a command it will run it. As `sudo` will warn you the first time it is started 'with great power power comes great responsibility.' If you don't know even the basics, suddenly you will find yourself running commands you have no understanding of blindly and hoping they work. **That means trusting whoever it is that is telling you what commands to run on your computer.** \n\nFor example, you might look up how to install a program and find a whole set of commands you need to run on some shitty clickbait site. If you don't know what \"curl\" is, suddenly you might be downloading random zips from the internet and shoving them into core spots on your system. You might end up compiling something you cloned into your home directory via git clone. You might end up with a huge mess or something actively malicious if you downloaded code from from an unofficial source. When it turns out all you really needed to do was click install in your software manager. \n\nSo while you don't need to use the terminal.... you need to know how to use it.\n\n#tl:dr; You can do almost everything without the terminal but every guide to linux, forum help post, etc. will tell you commands to run and it's bad news bears to run things with no understanding of what strangers are telling you to do to your computer.",

I hate jargon and like to explain things in a straight forward way.\n\nIf people like it, I already have an idea for a second tutoiral on lxc and lxd so you can make the most of your one free EC2 server.\n\nEdit: As /u/mdaffin pointed out. The AWS EC2 instance is offered free for 12 months. After that there is a cost of $0.0116 an hour which works out to be $8.63 a month; still cheaper than most VPN services out there and this way you have full control.\n\nEdit 2: I am half way through writing this. I have decided to do a mini tutorial after this on installing a web interface for OpenVPN. It requires a few prereq's so it's too much to put in one tutorial, besides getting used to the terminal is always better and OpenVPN is super easy to admin. Unfortunately, I now have the pleasure of having to go and move a clients office for the next 7 hours. Hopefully I can finish it tonight, if not tomorrow! I will still keep an eye on this thread and answer questions, comments and discuss.\n\n\nEdit 3: So it seems like there is a lot of interest in this and I am so excited to do it for you all! Currently I am finishing up an Office move and cursing the printer gods (seriously, who decided that printers were ever a good idea). Should be done in a few hours so will be finalising it then!\n\nEdit4: OK 3/5 through writing it. Just need to write up about OpenVPN and NoIP (which suprisingly is the least of it...). Also need to proof read to make sure it all makes sense. I have a habbit of words of sentenses :p\n\n**EDIT 5:** Guide is up.

But that may be naive.\n\nLenovo laptop, bought new about two years ago, running Windows 11.\n\nWhat I know right now is, about an hour ago, he decided to try to install an ubuntu partition on his external hard drive, because it would be cool (that is his explicit explanation). He's a curious kid, it's fine, I knew when I gave him the laptop that things like this might be in the cards no matter how much I urged him to come to me first before messing with the depths of the thing. No problem.\n\nBut as he describes it, it \"didn't work\" and he thought he had good instructions for how to just remove the ubuntu partition in such a case, and let windows have that drive space back and that also \"didn't work\".\n\nNow grub loads up on the laptop whether or not the external hard drive in question is plugged in, which scares him that he's messed something up deep within the darkest depths. He can hit F12 during boot to select windows instead, and so far everything seems to work fine within Windows, but if he doesn't hit F12 it does go to grub. \n\nSo the things he (and I) would like to see happen now if possible are:\n\n1. The laptop itself no longer has whatever alteration to its kernel happened that makes it go to grub is undone, and\n2. The partition on his external drive goes away, and becomes part of his main partition again, withot him having to reformat the entire disk losing all the apps he has on it in the windows partition\n\nHe is calming down enough that I can ask him further questions depending on what additional info you need.\n\nIn case I have given a wrong impression he is not crying and inarticulate out of some \"brattiness\" or \"stubbornness,\" he's just scared he messed up one of his most prized posessions. He was also scared I would be mad but I explained that I always hoped he'd be careful and talk to me first but also knew when I gave it to him that he's a curious kid and things like this might happen.

Once people get acclimated they will know better what they want and can start distro hopping.\n\nIf there is no interest then just down vote this to hell.\n\nI figured it should not be too overwhelming and the choice should be pretty basic.  Most if not all of us go through a distro hopping phase anyway.\n\n#What Distro Should I Use?\n\n**My computer is old.**\n\n* Xubuntu – This distro is just Ubuntu except it uses the XFCE desktop environment which is more light weight than Ubuntu’s stander desktop environment which is Gnome.\n\n* Mint XFCE – If you do not want to use Ubuntu another distro to consider is the XFCE version of Mint.  Mint is based off of Ubuntu but they modify enough of the system to be considered a different distribution.  Like Xubuntu Mint XFCE also uses the XFCE desktop environment.\n\n**My computer is modern**\n\n* Ubuntu – This is the most popular desktop distribution.  It uses the Gnome desktop environment which is very modern looking.  Since it is the most popular it is much easier to find solutions for issues on this distro since so many people use it.\n\n* PopOS – This distro has a more gaming oriented appeal but it works very well as an every day distro.  This is based on Ubuntu so almost any troubleshooting steps or guides you see for Ubuntu will work on this distro as well.\n\n* Manjaro – Unlike every other distro on this list, Manjaro is not based on Ubuntu.  Instead it is based on Arch.  What makes this different is that Arch always has the latest versions of software.  This can be bad as it can cause instability when updating.  Ubuntu based operating systems usually use software which is a few versions behind but it is more stable.",

    "body": "\n# \"Wait, what happens to Windows 7?\"\n\nAfter support ends (1/14/2020), Windows 7 is no longer going to receive security updates. Your computer will continue to work but since Windows 7 will be: 1) not uncommon, 2) lack security updates, 3) used mostly by  people who are not tech/security savvy and who ignored the warnings... it will become the juiciest target for malware out there right now. It'll be open season on grandparents and small businesses who are left on it.\n\nSo you have 2 options:\n\n1) upgrade to a newer version of Windows\n\n2) switch to Linux\n\nThis post is not going to be a Linux sales pitch. If you *want* Windows 10 and can run Windows 10 then install Windows 10.\n\n# \"Well what is Linux?\"\n\nLinux is a free operating system with an emphasis on open source software. It is free to download, try out and install. It is however, not Windows. Some things will work differently and there will be some of a learning curve for a new user.\n\n## Some things that work differently:\n\n* because it is free and open source, anyone can make their own version and distribute it to the community. We call each version put out by a particular group a \"**distro**\" for \"distribution.\" That's why you might see some ridiculously complicated graphs and suggestions for all the different versions of Linux (unlike with Windows where there are a few official versions all made by Microsoft)\n\n* because a lot of the software is free and open source, each distro can provide its users with a **repository** of a bunch of pre-packaged software designed to work on your system which you can install, run and update free of charge, this can then all be managed by a **package manager**. On the user side, this works like a phone app store where everything is free.\n\n* because it is free and open source, it can be seen as a threat to Microsoft making money so some software (*Microsoft Office*) will likely never be provided for Linux directly.\n\n* because it is less common than Windows, some companies simply don't make versions of their software for Linux. Adobe is a big one.\n\n# \"Ok, how do I try it out?\"\n\n## try out some Linux software on Windows before switching\n\nCheckout https://alternativeto.net/ , and search for any software you tend to use. You can then try out a lot of the stuff available for Linux on Windows too. (edit: this includes MS Office alternatives).\n\nFor an organized list of linux software there’s this: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/list_of_applications\n\n## Use a virtual machine\n\nUsing software like virtual box https://www.virtualbox.org/ you can run Linux inside a program on Windows. This is a really great way to try it because you can do whatever you want in the virtual machine (VM) without changing things on your actual machine. The downside is that your computer has to run both Linux and Windows at the same time while doing this so it might not work well on low spec hardware and it won't let you test that all everything works on your hardware. \n\n## Boot into the live environment\n\nLinux can actually run off of a USB stick. Doing this let's you test it out on your actual hardware and make sure that everything works correctly without changing anything on your harddrive. The downside is that you generally can't save changes while running off a USB stick so this is intended for testing, installing and recovering but not for extended use or experimentation.\n\n# \"I'm interested in trying it out, what should I start with?\"\n\n## Do you want something that looks different from windows?\n\nUbuntu is the classic newbie friendly Linux distro. By default it has a desktop environment that looks a little more like Mac than Windows but is distinctly different from both. Most Linux instructions online will include help on Ubuntu and there's lots of good forums to help. Ubuntu releases a new version every 6 months but maintains a long term support (LTS) release that is supported for 5 years. The 6 month version will have newer software, the LTS version will have (increasingly) older software but still get security updates for that supported time.\n\nUbuntu's install guide is here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GraphicalInstall\n\n## Do you want a windows like desktop environment?\n\nLinux Mint is an even more newbie friendly Linux distro that is based on Ubuntu's LTS release. It's essentially just LTS Ubuntu with some extra help like backup integration and a more windows-like UI. That means basically all of the Ubuntu guides and help carry over but you'll feel more at home coming from Windows 7.\n\nLinux Mint's install guide is here: https://linuxmint-installation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ (and it's very well put together for a newbie)\n\n# \"Looks good! Now what?\"\n\nKnow that while you can do almost everything on Ubuntu and Mint through a graphical interface, a lot of advice and help will give you things to run on the commandline (even if you could do it other ways). Don't be scared of the commandline but also try to look up what you are running to understand it yourself; it's a way of telling your computer exactly what you want it to do... efficient and powerful if you know the basics but it's not a good idea to trust every random person who gives you a command to run from the internet.\n\nLinux malware/viruses are extremely rare and you won't get anything bad if you download from the official repositories. Part of the reason is that most of the time, you are not giving programs permission to install, update or change things on your system. To give them permission, you need to enter the \"root password\" so that anything where you aren't entering your password or typing \"sudo\" can only affect your documents and personal stuff but anything where you entering your password can make bigger changes to your system. Take note of anytime someone is telling you to add a new repository or download and run something from somewhere else. \n\nIf for some reason Ubuntu and Mint are not working for you, you can start branching out and trying other distros. Everyone's got their own favorite but these are just the best places to start. To learn in a more in-depth structured way check out: https://linuxjourney.com/\n\n**Have fun with it!**",

    "body": "I've been using computers for almost 40 years now. I consider myself a power user. Over the years, I've used systems like the Commodore 64, Amiga, Macintosh, and PC. Most of my time was spent with Windows.\n\nHowever, for the last 15 years or so, using a computer had become more of a habit than a passion. New versions of Windows kept coming out, but instead of adding innovative features, they started stripping things down and they called it \"user experience.\" It reached a point where I felt like they were dictating which software I should use, what features I should have access to, and how I was supposed to use my computer.\n\nEventually, I very well realized that my Windows operating system was doing all sorts of things in the background. It was sending and receiving data over the internet without telling me or asking for my permission. Using my personal computer began to feel more like using a company-owned or shared machine. That seriously bothered me.\n\nWhen Windows 10 support was announced to be ending, I upgraded to Windows 11 and unfortunately, I discovered that all of the issues I mentioned above were even worse in it. It felt like the computer was no longer mine. Even during the installation process, setup forced me to sign in with a Microsoft account. That felt like a roundabout way of saying, *\"You must be connected to the internet, because we want your data. No data, no install.\"*\n\nThat's when I joined the migration from Windows to Linux. For the past month, I’ve tried out many different distros and hopped from one to another. Since I’m -somewhat experienced computer- user, I didn’t face any major issues, even with my initial hesitations about some distributions. I thought my NVIDIA card would cause major problems but I only had minor annoyances. In terms of user experience, using Linux has been incredibly satisfying. As I learned to use the terminal more and more, I started moving away from the GUI. I now get my daily tasks done faster and more efficiently, and it’s actually enjoyable. Learning Linux made me love my computer again.\n\nI haven’t felt this kind of excitement about technology in a long time, probably not since the 90s, when I installed a 3Dfx Graphics Accelerator into my PC and launched \"Quake II\". In terms of gaming performance, Fedora (which I currently use and settled) holds up surprisingly well -if not on par- compared to Windows.\n\nTo be honest, I’ve burned the ships behind me. I converted all my storage/backup drives to Linux file formats and I have no plans to go back. I feel like the time and effort I’ve invested into this system is truly paying off.\n\nSo, to those reading this who feel trapped in the Windows ecosystem, don’t be afraid. Don’t hesitate. On 99% of the computers out there, you can have the same experience I had. And if you have any problems, there are thousands of people willing to help you.\n\nLastly, I want to say thank you to Linux and its community.  \nI'm glad you are there.",

(i only heard of gnome, cinnammon, kde)\n\n3. my personal picks of os: linux mint cinnamon, bazzite, pop_os. \nare these good choices for linux beginners to install and use easily for windows users?\n\n4. what os can run fine with nvidia gpus? (i have nvidia 3060 msi ventus)\n\n5. can linux recognize window files from usb drive (photos, jpg, pdf)?\n\n6. for games with anti-cheat, does anyone here dual boot windows for online games? (crew motorfest, halo mcc)\n\n7. what rgb software can i use to change the led parts? (usevia.app for keyboard, razer for basilisk mouse, openrgb for nzxt lcd cooler, etc)\n\n8. can any linux programs run windows software or should i use a browser to access microsoft stuff online?

It's an exercise that really makes me look at humanity differently. Anyway. \n\nI forced her to watch the 1982 bell labs film about Unix where Brian kernighan looks cool as fuck rocking his Tims with his feet up on that old school ass console explaining how badass Unix is, and how you can pipe commands together. \n\nShe started to get what he was saying but said to me: \"why would I go to all that trouble typing all that stuff when I can just click the spellcheck button\"\n\nI tried to make my own similar example to show her how what worked in 1982 Unix still works. Sadly uppercase, lowercase, makewords etc don't come on manjaro xfce standard and don't appear to be in the repo (likely because basic shell manip can do that).\n\nSo I got ballsy, and tried showing her the power of sed instead. I made a bullshit file, while explaining to her vaguely that everything was a file, I typed \"touch kitties\" - and she was not astounded upon my next reflexive 'L's -m' to see the file existed in the directory. I got a little cocky, and began to show her the contents of my directory using many arguments - our hidden files tingled in sync as I threw down an ls -lAphXvlmnopqrsT\n\nI opened vim and wowed her with all the characters pressed before any characters appeared on screen. I filled that file full of kitties this and kitties that.\n\nAnd for my next trick: :wq!\n\nShe was aghast - mind completely blown. The application closed itself as if it were magic. As if it took a mere 5 character presses instead of a single click. I gloated a little about how I coulda just saved that file without permission like a fucking badass. \n\nAt this point she's pretty wet, she's inching closer, I know she can see the sharply defined nipples of my ter-112n console font. \n\nI'm about to drop the most clever shit any dude has ever in the presence of a lady willing to watch a man pound away awkwardly at the terminal:\n\n&gt;cat kitties\n\nThe text file fills the terminal (I made sure to ^L first)\n\nThen I did it\n\n&gt;cat kitties | sed -r \"s/kitties/doggos/g\" \n\nAnd here I am on reddit where I went to cozy up on the couch where I'll be sleeping tonight, and post about my endeavors.\n\nIt's fun to be back.

    "title": "Tips from a Noob: The most helpful ideas I've learned in my first six months of using Linux (summary: Take NOTES, start snapshots immediately, and stick with best practices)",
    "body": "*Edit: Thank you, Anonymous user, for the Platinum! &lt;3*\n\nI've been using Ubuntu 19.04/19.10 for six months and wanted to share what has helped me out the most so far in my journey. I'll keep this as succinct as I can. Here you go!\n\n## Take notes on any changes you make to your system\n\nThis includes every package you install. I have a `refs` directory in my Dropbox folder with some markdown files for different ideas I'm learning. I chose markdown to practice that format but text files work fine. I have files for:\n\n* **tmux:** commands and hotkeys I'm working on committing to memory\n* **vim:** commands, hotkeys, and notes on plugins (I mostly use neovim but still take notes in this file)\n* **ricing:** has a full, simplified markdown table of all my i3 keybindings (helps me see what hotkeys I'm NOT using yet!)\n* **webdev:** reminders of which webdev concepts were covered in the courses I've taken, plus an ongoing list of ideas for projects\n* **journey:** the ongoing plan I'm following for learning web development from HTML5 all the way up to React/Redux\n* **general linux:** has an **Installation Timeline** (any apt/snap/pip/pip3 install is noted here), **Things To Research** (if I see something online but don't have time to look into it, I put it in this section), **Script Ideas**, **Diagnostics** (sysadmin stuff I'm committing to memory), and a generic **Notes** section for when I do something tedious and don't want to forget it (like how I set up each of my drive's partitions/filesystems)\n* **markdown:** A full, super simple list of all markdown formatting so I can get better at creating repos while helping myself stay more organized\n\nThere is no need to do all of this, but I like this separation of ideas so it can scale with me for years. Whenever I start learning about something specific and vast enough to warrant extensive notes, I will make a new file.\n\nI have an alias for each file so they are always a few keystrokes away from being in front of me. You could also just alias the directory. I use `refX` where X is the letter for that file. `refv` for vim, `reft` for tmux, `refl` for general linux, and so on.\n\n**Edit:** An awesome suggestion from u/wrek: **\"Make ONE change at a time.\"** Super valid point. Make a habit of installing, then testing, making changes, then testing, and so on. If you do five things with no testing and find out something broke, you now have five directions to go. Even if what broke leads you to reaching out for help, you'll know exactly *how* to ask for help if you know what change caused the breaking.\n\n## Get to know your filesystem\n\nI'd suggest doing this before you get that far into installing anything, but it's never too late to know your filesystem.\n\n[This video from Engineer Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFIoRLqhFpo) and [this video from DorianDotSlash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbgzrKJvDRw) helped me a lot!\n\nAfter watching these, I stopped trying to manually install anything beyond the home directory. Some applications like [simple terminal](https://st.suckless.org/) or packages you download will automatically put themselves somewhere outside the home directory and I let those applications do what they were designed to do, but if I manually install stuff it is usually in `~/.local` or something like that.\n\nThis is what I meant by \"stick with best practices\". It seems ideal to stay out of most deeper directories until you know what you're doing. I'm still a noob so I'll stay at home where it's safe :)\n\n## Snapshots, Snapshots, Snapshots\n\nIf you haven't already, use something like [Timeshift](https://github.com/teejee2008/timeshift) or [rsync](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync) to start taking snapshots as soon as possible.\n\nThis suggestion saved my ass when I tried, stumbled, and failed at setting up as many applications as possible to change colors via pywal. I didn't keep track of how I set it all up and when I decided to try dismantling it, I couldn't remember how to get everything back to \"pre-pywal\" setup.\n\nLuckily I had a Timeshift snapshot from about 10 minutes after my fresh OS install. **Installing Timeshift and getting snapshots started, including taking an initial manual snapshot that would never get auto-deleted, is the first thing I did after installing Ubuntu.**\n\nThat was easily the smartest decision I made last year and it took about 12 minutes to undo a month's worth of disorganized configuring.\n\nAfter that, I started taking notes on everything I installed and set everything up more carefully. Although I've messed up small stuff since then, I have also been able to refer to notes and undo them no problem. My system (and brain) feel a lot more stable.\n\nMy Timeshift setup is pretty simple. I have daily snapshots and boot snapshots (max of 7 snapshots for each type), plus a few manual snapshots that get me back to \"10 minutes post-install\" if needed.\n\n## For non-system files, try to be cloud based\n\nAside from my Downloads folder, every file in my home directory is in Dropbox. Most folders in `$HOME` are symlinks to their equivalent in Dropbox, and I have automatic backups for anything else (like stuff from `~/.config`, `~/.fonts`, etc). Those are also backed up into Dropbox.\n\n**Edit:** This could also be done with a server you run/own, or another cloud storage service of some sort. The goal with this suggestion is to **have your files stored in a way that protects you from a drive failure**. Don't store everything only on your main working drive because you'll be screwed if it gives out. An external, ideally automated solution for file storage lets you pick back up where you left off immediately after replacing a drive without losing any data.\n\n## If you have time and interest, try doing something the hard way\n\nrsync is a great choice for backing up files in your home directory. I could have just used its extensive options, but decided it'd be fun to write a script that handles those backups instead. By doing that I wound up learning a lot about writing scripts.\n\nFor some reason I've had a hard time getting Dropbox to show up on Polybar. That tray icon is how I usually manage my sync settings. I can still log out of i3 and into GNOME to pull those settings up, but I realized I could also [make a Rofi-powered menu](https://github.com/NicksIdeaEngine/dropboxsyncmenu) to manage those settings. It was another fun learning experience in scripting, and more practice on setting up repositories.\n\n## Share your work!\n\nDid you write a script? Post it in r/bash and ask for input. You'll probably hear some great suggestions on simplifying or improving it!\n\nIf you love customizing, post your setup in r/unixporn for others to see.\n\nShare your creations. You'll get valuable feedback, help a fellow noob, or both!\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTake notes, get to know your filesystem, start using snapshots if you haven't already, leverage the cloud, keep an eye out for fun challenges that'll force you to learn something, and if you make something useful go ahead and share it with the community.\n\nKnowing the easy AND hard way might seem redundant, but the point is practice. Someday you'll encounter something that doesn't have an easy solution, and you'll be better prepared if you've tackled challenging problems already.",

    "title": "Putting Linux on your Mac? Watch out!",
    "body": "Many people want Linux on their Mac- they are tired of Apple, or maybe they got a Mac just to use for Linux.\n\nI think that's a great idea!\n\nHowever, if you wipe out the original MacOS hard drive partition when installing Linux ... there may be chips on your Mac that use firmware on that MacOS partition. Oops. Also, firmware gets updated all the time. Maybe a new WiFi spec comes out, with a new kind of password security, all the hotspots will be using it soon. Your Mac may support it- with a firmware update. Boot MacOS, do an update, and MacOS will get the new firmware. No MacOS partition? Oooops.\n\nA lot of people select \"Use Entire Hard Drive\" when they install Linux on their Mac. I see posts all over the internet - \"I installed Linux, and now I need such-and-such firmware, how do I get it? What website has it?\" Much of the firmware is copyright and can not be posted on a website. It was on the MacOS partition. Now ... Oh well.\n\nWatch out! Best if you don't delete your existing MacOS partition when installing Linux.\n\nKeeping the MacOS partition is not easy using most Linux installers. This is because Linux installers typically use free disk space outside of any partition when installing. MacOS disk utilities do not easily create free space, they just make and adjust partitions.\n\nHere's what I do. I start MacOS. Run Disk Utility. Right click on the hard drive at the top of the left pane, and select Partition... Click '+' for a new partition, and then \"Add Partition\". Select ExFAT for the Format, which will be changed later. Select however much of the hard drive you want for Linux, but leave enough so that MacOS still fits. If you do not leave enough Disk Utility will let you know. Click Apply. Let it grind for a minute making the space for Linux. Then, reboot to your chosen Linux installer. When the installer is asking how to use the disk, select \"Manual\" or whatever your installer provides, do not select Use Entire Disk or Use Largest Free Space. In the disk partition table it then shows, select the space in the new partition, and then delete the partition. You can typically tell which partition is the new one by the size you made it. Be careful to select the correct partition! Then set up your Linux on this new free space, for example by selecting Guided and then Use Largest Free Space. If there is no Guided or similar selection on the Manual partition table menu, you may have to go back in the menu one or more times to get to a menu asking how to use the disk, depending on your installer.\n\nOnce Linux is being set up in the free space, you can forget about your MacOS. Even with a MacOS partition, a Mac will typically boot to Linux after a Linux install. To get back to MacOS when you need it, try installing something like \"refind\" for multi-boot. This tool is installable under Linux and MacOS, and I have been using it for years. MacOS multi-boot under \"grub\", the normal Linux boot system, does not work reliably for me. You do not need to worry about multi-boot at first if you are only interested in Linux- your Mac will boot Linux after the install. You only need to worry about multi-boot when you want to get back to MacOS, e.g. for your firmware. You can boot to MacOS without multi-boot by holding down Alt during a Mac restart, useful if you do not intend to run MacOS very often. It can be tricky to press Alt at the right time for this.\n\nTypically what happens is something does not work. You google it. You find that the problem is caused by missing firmware. You google it some more. You find instructions that tell you how to copy the missing firmware from MacOS to Linux. You (silently) thank me. You google for this post on reddit, and re-read the previous paragraph. Then you thank me out loud. Then you do the instructions, whatever it was starts working, and you completely forget about me. It's ok, I am used to it. Remember, there are people who have spent many thousands of hours of their lives working on Linux itself. Do we ever remember to thank them?\n\nWish this were simpler and more direct. I actually do it slightly differently: I do not delete the ExFAT partition, but use Configure LVM and convert the ExFAT to an LVM physical partition, but that seems even more complicated. Anybody have any simpler ways to keep a little MacOS, let me know! Also, please add a comment if your installer has different steps for Guided installation into the new partition made by Disk Utility than mine.",

In my time here trying to be a good egg and helping folks, I have seen may doubts about how many bits your CPU has, what version is the adequate, \"I have an Intel CPU but I only see AMD64 as download option\", and other questions related.\n\nWell, this post aims to clarify doubts that gravitate around this topics.\n\nFirst of all, we need to talk about two characteristics a CPU has:\n\n# Bit Length\n\nI assume you already know that CPUs and by extent computers work with zeroes and ones that we call bits. Well, those bits come always in groups, the most famous being 8 bits, and we call that a *byte*.\n\nBut because of math, with 8 bits we can only count from 0 to 255, so with time and newer tech computers started to use more and more bits inside them. The amount of bits the CPU uses to process things is called a *word*.\n\nNowdays computers are 64 bit, meaning that the world length of your average computer is 64 bits long, but from the mid 90's to late 2000's most computers were 32 bit, and it is not rare to see some of them now and then.\n\n# CPU Architecture\n\nIn the end, a CPU is a really complex integrated circuit that reads the instructions that make a program, and then executes them. But that does not say what instructions are available, and how the CPU handles them and makes something useful of them.\n\nAll of that is dictated by the CPU Architecture. as the name implies, the architecture is how things are laid out in the CPU, dictating how it works, and more importantly the *set of instructions* it can understand and thus, work on.\n\nBack in the day architectures popped right and left, each with their own proprietary instruction set. But nowdays, only a handful of Instruction sets are used, and CPU architectures are made to comply to those sets, so nowdays saying CPU architecture or instruction set is almost the same.\n\nI need to remark this: word length and CPU architecture are **NOT** the same. the word length (how many bits your CPU handles) is a part on the CPU architecture, but not the entire architecture. You can have a 64-bit ARM CPU, a 64-bit RISC-V CPU and so on. Think of it as how many wheels a truck has vs what type of engine it has.\n\nSaid that, let's get to the topic shall we?\n\nAlthough several architectures exists out there like ARM, RISC-V and PowerPC, currently the most prominent CPU architecture out there is the so called x86. Put simply, if you have an Intel or AMD CPU, you have an x86 CPU.\n\n# x86 A.K.A i386 A.K.A IA-32\n\nIt all starts in the late 70's when intel made the **intel 8086** CPU. it was simply a 16-bit version of the early intel 8080, but because it was used on the IBM PC (well, a cousin of it, the 8088), it became an instant hit, not only because of IBM, but because all the so called *IBM Compatible* machines that came after, with brands like Acer, Compaq, HP, Dell, and other you may have heard.\n\nBecause of it's popularity Intel kept improving them, with the release in 1982 of the **intel 80186** and the **intel 80286** which were compatible with the OG 8086, because all had the same instruction set.\n\nin 1985 intel took the step to the 32-bit realm with the launch of the intel 80386, and launching it with the name **i386** (dropping the 80 in the front). It was still compatible with it's predecessors to an extent.\n\nin 1989 the next chapter came in the saga: the intel **i486**. Do you guys have seen the pattern yet? all CPUs of this *lineage* end in 86. That is the reason this architecture is called x86. Another name given to is is IA-32, standing for Intel Architecture - 32 bit.\n\nBu the early 90's intel tried to crush their competitors and attempted to trademark i586 and subsequent x86 naming, but that did not worked, so in 1993, the fifth instance on the saga came out: **Pentium**, coming from the greek word for five: penta. Some people still liked to call it **i586** tho.\n\nThe next iteration came as the P6 microarchitecture, that saw the light as the Pentium Pro and Pentium II and Pentium III. Because of that people like to call this generation of CPU's **i686**.\n\nPeople nowdays don't keep the count of what generation of something86 as the CPUs of today have more ranges and tiers, but in the core, they are all descendants of the i386.\n\nThe intel i386 was the first x86 CPU to be 32-bit, so it serves as a lowest common denominator for modern x86 hardware. that is the reason software written for x86 32 bit computers is often labeled as **i386**, **x86** or sometimes **x32** (the latter more common in windows). If I may go into *ackthsually* mode, x86 refers to the instruction set that dates back to the 16-bit 8086, while anything 32-bit from the i386 onwards is called **IA-32**.\n\nbut because some software may need things that only came until newer generations of CPUs, some use the \"fan-made\" x86 numbers in the saga to signify that the software needs at least stuff from that generation, so one can find software to be labeled **i686** as it requires instructions and new components only found in P6 CPUs and newer ones.\n\n# AMD64 on Intel CPUs?\n\nRemember that I said that intel tried to patent i586 to screw competitors? That is becauae Intel was not the only company making x86-compatible CPUs. Other companies were Texas Instruments, Cyrix, WinChip and Advanced Micro Devices. Only the last survives to this day as the sole competitor on the x86 CPU market, now known only for it's initials: **AMD**.\n\nWhen intel came up with Pentium, AMD launched the Am5x86, The Pentium II and III were against the AMD K5 and K6 series, and so on...\n\nBut in the new millennium, AMD took the x86 architecture, and brought it to the 64-bit level. That is why it is called **x86-64**, **x86\\_64**, **AMD64** or sometimes **x64**. The first CPU to sport the new architecture was the AMD Opteron.\n\nIntel then made some cross-licensing agreements so they could make 64-bit CPUs, with the Intel Xeon being the first Intel 64 CPU in 2004.\n\nBecause of limited capabilities (mainly only being able to access 4GB of RAM), support of 32-bit x86 has been phasing out, with the last 32-bit only CPUs made around 2011.\n\n\n\nWith that being said, unless you are trying to revive a Windows XP-era PC that still has a floppy drive and tons of obsolete memory card readers on the front, you most certainly have a computer or laptop with an x86-64 CPU, be either an Intel Pentium, Celeron or Core, or an AMD A-Series, Athlon, Phenom, FX or Ryzen, all of them trace their origins to that i386 that saw the light in the mid 80's.\n\n\n\nMeaning that yes, you can forget about the 32-bit version of that program and use the \"amd64\" version in your Core i9 gaming rig.",

    "title": "Ditching Windows because of Windows 11? Not sure which Linux to install? Choose Fedora or Mint, here's why.",
    "body": "With the end of Windows 10 support in a few days, and Windows 11 being the most intrusive OS to date, many people might consider switching to Linux. Since there are a bunch of distros (AKA distributions) out there, choosing one can feel overwhelming (I know I was overwhelmed when I first started to learn about Linux).\n\nSo here are my recommendations for anyone ditching Windows for good:\n\n**Linux Mint (Cinnamon Edition)**\n\n* Very familiar interface to Windows 10\n* Stable, reliable, beginner-friendly\n* A lot of media codecs already preinstalled so videos and music just work\n* Great gaming support thanks to Steam and Proton compatibility layer (I've run several Windows-only games this way)\n* One of most popular distros, so there are tons of quality guides\n\nI've been using Mint for well over a year now, and I genuinely. In fact, I even posted about [my experience using it for a year](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmint/comments/1mubg8k/today_marks_one_year_of_using_linux_mint_daily/).\n\n**Fedora (KDE Plasma Edition)**\n\n* Traditional desktop layout, similar to Windows, that can be customized to your heart's content\n* Lightweight, but feature-rich\n* Faster update cycles than Mint (meaning more up-to-date software)\n* A lot of things preinstalled, which can sometimes be a bit overwhelming, but you'll get used to it quickly\n\nThere's also the Workstation edition based on GNOME desktop environment, which doesn't let you customize as much. Basically, the philosophy behind it is \"less is more\". It looks very modern, and takes a bit to get used to since it doesn't look like what most people are used to with Windows. It works better on laptops because of the trackpad gesture options.\n\n**Some things to know beforehand**\n\n* Back your data before installing! Seriously. Get an external hard drive, and store all your important files there because you'll lose them once you decide to install new OS.\n* You can try the Linux without installing it first by making the \"Live USB\". Basically putting the OS on a USB stick, and selecting in BIOS to boot up from USB first.\n* I know it's daunting, but you can relax: You don't *have* to learn terminal. Modern Linux distros come with GUI tools for almost everything. Learning the terminal later is super useful, but not necessary right away.\n* On that note, installing software is super easy, barely an inconvenience. Use the built-in Software Manager. It's basically like the App store on your phone, just for Linux programs.\n* Flatpak is your friend. It's a way to install programs without worrying about compatibility issues. You can find a bunch of cool stuff to install on [Flathub](https://flathub.org/en), which will quickly become your favorite \"hub\" website.\n* Distro-hopping (trying different distros) is fun and all, but there's no need to chase the \"perfect\" one. Because there is no perfect distro. Most users won't need the niche features a lot of distros offer anyway. I recommend choosing one, and sticking with it. Mint and Fedora are both excellent and you'll be happy with either.\n\nI am sure people in the comments can add more to pros for both Mint and Fedora, and I welcome all to do so.\n\nEnjoy your newfound freedom.",

    "body": "**NOTE:** this is a draft document, edits will be made as time allows. Please add your comments so I can improve it. Also, if I screwed up, please let me know that too.\n\n**The low-down:** Microsoft terminated support for Windows XP on April 8, 2014.\n\n**What to do:** Your decision, but here we recommend you upgrade your computer to Linux.\n\n**How do I:** An overview of the migration process is as follows:\n\n1. run a backup\n2. select a distribution\n3. download the ISO\n4. verify the hash of the ISO (aside from security, this also will detect a corrupted download)\n5. burn the ISO to CD and/or load it onto a USB stick/drive (to do this, try [YUMI](http://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/) or [UNetbootin](http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/) - more [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tools_to_create_Live_USB_systems))\n6. do a test boot with a LiveCD if possible (optional, recommended)\n7. install the new OS\n8. configure/install any missing drivers/troubleshooting etc\n9. select/install software\n10. migrate users' data from the old OS to the new OS\n\n**Selecting a distribution:** \n\nHave a look at the various Linux distributions available (there's quite a few to choose from) and make a shortlist of possibles. Many of them have a \"Live CD\" which is a version of the system on CD, which can be downloaded and burned, then you boot off the CD and you can see whether the software works for you, without making any changes to your existing Windows install. You can find a list of distributions in many places, including these:\n\n- [The /g/ OS guide](http://i.imgur.com/wXsA1Ls.jpg) (updated to v.1.3.2)\n- [Comparison of Linux distributions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Linux_distributions)\n- [DistroWatch](http://www.distrowatch.com/)\n\nWe can't recommend a particular distribution here, but try the comments, or the articles linked below, or just browse the sidebar. Several distributions have been specifically designed to provide a Windows-like experience, a list of these is below. You could also try the [Linux Distribution Chooser](http://www.zegeniestudios.net/ldc/) (2011).\n\n**Windows-like distributions:**\n\n- [Lubuntu](http://lubuntu.net/) - [install guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/InstallingLubuntu)\n- [Xubuntu](http://xubuntu.org/)\n- [Kubuntu](http://kubuntu.org/)\n- [Linux Lite](https://www.linuxliteos.com/) - [install guide](https://www.linuxliteos.com/manual/install.html)\n- [Linux Mint - Mate edition](http://www.linuxmint.com/) (the heaviest one in this list)\n\n**Lightweight distributions:** (suited to older or low-powered hardware)\n\n- [Lubuntu](http://lubuntu.net/) - [install guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/InstallingLubuntu)\n- [CrunchBang Linux](http://crunchbang.org/)\n- [Bodhi Linux](http://www.bodhilinux.com/)\n- [DistroWatch search - \"Old Computers\" category](http://distrowatch.com/search.php?category=Old+Computers)\n- [list of Lightweight Linux distributions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Linux_distribution)\n\n**Important details:**\n\n- **Run a backup:** That way, even if you toast your machine, you will be able to recover your data. If your backup software has a \"verify\" feature, use it. You'll want to backup to an external device, if possible. Do NOT back up your data onto your existing C: drive, as if you somehow delete your C: drive during installation of Linux, your backup will be deleted too.\n- **CPU type:** When downloading Linux, ensure to select the correct build for your CPU. Many distributions have separate downloads for 32-bit or 64-bit CPU architectures - they also may have downloads for non-X86 CPUs. If you're migrating from Windows, you'll likely want X86, 32-bit or 64-bit.\n- **Dual-booting:** if you want to keep your Windows install, you can do that by using \"dual boot\", where you select which OS you want to use from a menu when you first power on the machine. This topic is a bit complex for this post, so we recommend making a post about it if you have queries (you could try [this search](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/search?q=dual+boot&amp;restrict_sr=on) too). Dual-boot (sometimes called multi-boot) is a good way to experiment. However, you will need to have sufficient diskspace to hold both operating systems at once.\n- **Drivers:** This can get tricky, especially for newer, consumer-grade hardware. If you find a problem here, please make a post about it so we can assist. Using a live CD can show up problems here before you spend time on a full install.\n- **Applications:** Linux does not natively support Windows programs, so you'll need to find a \"workalike\" for each Windows application you use. You can also try [Wine](https://winehq.org/), which lets some Windows applications run on unix-like systems, including Linux. However this may not work for your particular needs, you'll need to test it to see. There is a compatibility list [here](https://appdb.winehq.org/). If you have DOS apps, try [DOSbox](http://www.dosbox.com/) or [DOSEMU](http://www.dosemu.org/). It's also possible to \"virtualize\" your Windows install, using software such as [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), and run it in a window under Linux.\n- **Secure boot:** newer machines have a feature which can prevent non-Windows operating systems from booting. You may need to disable Secure Boot in your BIOS if your hardware has this feature.\n\n**Recommended reading:**\n\n- [I'm thinking of making a complete switch to Linux, thoughts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/1xu4u3/im_thinking_of_making_a_complete_switch_to_linux/)\n- [As a beginner, which build of Linux should I first install to learn the basics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/21b76u/as_a_beginner_which_build_of_linux_should_i_first/)\n- [L4NG: The basics of Linux](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/225f4r/l4ng_the_basics_of_linux/)\n- [What are your must haves for your Linux machine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/1w80uc/what_are_your_must_haves_for_your_linux_machine/)\n- [Need help picking a distro?

There's also GIMP, but it's much more complicated.\n- Silverlight - [Pipelight](http://fds-team.de/cms/articles/2013-08/pipelight-using-silverlight-in-linux-browsers.html) and a user-agent switcher will let you use Silverlight-based websites on Linux.\n- Flash - The last version of Flash player is 11.2. To get the latest Flash, you can either use Chrome, or install Flash player through Pipelight.\n\nNote that you should use your package manager to install programs, instead of downloading them from websites.\n\n**Migrating your data:**\n\n- Copy your personal files onto a USB drive.\n- Backup your browser profile onto the USB drive too so you can restore your bookmarks. This will only work if you will use the same browser. If you're changing browsers, try using the import feature of your new browser to restore your old bookmarks.\n- User data on Windows XP computers is usually found in the locations below:\n\n| item | location\n| ---|---\n| Desktop|C:\\Documents and Settings\\USERNAME\\Desktop \n| Favorites (Internet Explorer)|C:\\Documents and Settings\\USERNAME\\Favorites\n| My Documents|C:\\Documents and Settings\\USERNAME\\My Documents (note: the Downloads, Music, My Pictures, My Videos collections subdirectories may be large) \n| Contacts (Outlook Express)|C:\\Documents and Settings\\USERNAME\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Address Book\n| Contacts (Outlook)|N/A - is contained in the PST\n| email (Outlook Express)|C:\\Documents and Settings\\USERNAME\\Local Settings\\Application Data\\Identities\\XXXXX\\Microsoft\\Outlook Express (where XXXXX is a long string of alphanumeric characters)\n| email (Outlook 2003)|C:\\Documents and Settings\\USERNAME\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Outlook\n\nNotes: \n\n- This list is *not* complete - it covers the standard locations for popular software only.\n- Each user on a Windows XP machine has a separate profile, these are all stored in the *C:\\Documents and Settings* directory. Ensure to copy the data for each profile on the system.\n- Some directories (eg. Application Data) may be hidden, to browse to them, first enable \"show hidden files and folders\" (not detailed here).\n\n**Migration tips:**\n\n- When you're installing, try and have access to a second computer with a working internet connection. If you run into problems during the install, you can use the other computer to search for a solution.\n- If you encounter problems, don't forget to try any \"test installation media\", \"test memory\" and/or \"test hard disk\" options you may be offered.\n- Use the same wallpaper on your new Linux installation, it'll help make the transition easier.\n\n**Todo list for this doc:**\n\n- data: how to migrate? \n- partitioning: best practice, allowing for dual-boot\n- devices: common catches with cameras, smartphones, printers (esp. iTunes)\n- links to this kind of doc elsewhere on the web\n\n**Contributors to this doc:**\n\n- /u/PaperPlaneFlyer123, /u/Pi31415926, /u/provocatio, /u/spammeaccount\n\n**More information:**\n\nIf you have queries, please add your comment, or make a new post, we are happy to help.\n\n\\* That's [free as in freedom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software), not free as in free beer.

I installed Garry's Mod expecting it to not work like the last time I tried Linux, I followed the protondb guides to get gmod working and low and behold! It worked! I could join servers!\n\nThe other game I tried which was GTA 5, worked no issues at all either!\n\nNow, unfortunately I cannot fully ditch windows due to my reliance on adobe products and playing GTA FiveM servers (No Linux support 🥺).

Gamers, and those tied to Adobe or MS Office will still wish to stick with Windows.  However, there's a strong case to be made for productivity users considering Linux, as the performance gains are subsantial!\n\nThis is the last post I'll be making about this, as it's taken a fair bit of time and effort.",

    "body": "I LOVE IT. \n\nContext: my 2019-ish hp laptop straight up wouldn't update after a certain point (it had plenty of space), and even a clean install wouldn't work at all. Which was an issue because it would take 40-60 minutes to warm up enough to use Firefox without it freezing at every click. Plus, it acted like my WiFi connection was crazy unstable (which it isn't, judging from my other devices), and it seemed like it didn't have Bluetooth when, it did. \n\nIn the last few years I've tried pretty much all the driver related troubleshooting I could come across, but nothing it would only get worse. And Win10 won't get support anymore starting sometime in October.\n\nI was going to get a new laptop even though I just need to be able to write documents and browse the internet well enough. I asked for advice on here since said new laptop would start with no OS, and you people (lol) got me curious about Linux distros for beginners. I looked at the Linux mint site and just couldn't help but want to try it.\n\nSo, I moved all semi-important files to an external hard drive and installed Cinnamon with a USB stick.\n\nIt worked great, and the PC is snappy like it's literally never been before. Everything works from what I've seen, I changed the keyboard layout and added Japanese IME input as well (the language I set is English so of course it would assume my keyboard isn't Italian), but it all went pretty smoothly. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth fully work, and I loved seeing the different themes. (It's a small thing, but I like that stuff)\n\nI know I don't know a LOT of stuff, and I'll need to troubleshoot at some point. But that's the only way to learn. For now, I'm happy with it :)",

    "body": "I've been a Linux user full-time on my home PC for almost a year now, and I just want to encourage new Linux users, to take the time to learn some Linux basics, at least learning how to install and remove packages using the terminal. It really isn't as difficult as you might think.\n\nI wanted to share a story about what happened to me this morning that made me glad I learned just a little bit about how the terminal works. I was removing some font packages that were automatically installed with Cinnamon desktop that are for non-Latin alphabets, that I would never ever use, and just clog up my font list in LibreOffice. Well, apparently removing one of those packages caused several dependencies to also be removed and I was being quite careless, and it turned out those dependencies were integral to the functioning of my desktop, so much so that in the middle of my terminal session, the desktop stopped functioning, the screen turned black and the computer went back to the boot screen.\n\nI booted and lo and behold, all that would display was a black screen with blocky white letters asking me to enter my username and password. Basically I had no graphical desktop, I just had access to a terminal. 8 months ago, heck, even 2 months ago, I would have freaked out, probably grabbed my USB and just re-installed my OS, erasing all my data. But, because I had taken the time to learn a few commands I was able to calmly learn a few things. \n\nFirst I logged in and executed a list command (ls) to see whether I had lost any of my files or if this was a desktop issue. Luckily I saw all my folders intact. Next I was able to run neofetch, which is a program I installed which displays information about your system along with a logo in terminal (its pretty neat). Everything looked ok, but there was no desktop environment listed. So it just came down to having to reinstall the desktop, which I was able to do by running the simple install command and installing Cinnamon desktop again. \n\nAfter rebooting, the desktop came back online and amazingly was even still configured exactly as I left it.\n\nBy knowing 2 basic commands I was able to correct a small mistake that seemed huge. So I really encourage new users to take the time how to do a few basic things in the terminal in the event that something like accidentally breaking your desktop environment happens, you can confidently and proudly correct it.",

    "body": "Hey been using Linux Mint for some time and thought I'd throw some pro's and con's out there, mostly gaming related but with a few other notable things.   \nIf you are on Linux and run into any issues related to the below send me a message. Otherwise I hope it helps you decide if you haven't switched.\n\n**The Good**\n\n* Absolutely no issues when installing Linux on its own hard drive\n* Steam works flawlessly with the majority of games, maybe 20% needed launch options that can be found on protondb, the other 5% needed a little more work\n* Hardware worked out the box, I didn't have to install drivers manually like I expected\n* Not having bloatware is a huge positive, the whole OS just works faster\n* Updates can be done much quicker and easier than windows\n\n**The Bad**\n\n* NTFS hard drives can be used, but I had to manually mount them in the terminal so I could access the games on steam, a lot of those games then didn't work when running off that hard drive. They can be moved over to your main drive easily though through steam, making migrating from windows fairly easy.\n* ~~Discord screen sharing is a problem, I had to use a custom client (vencord) and install pipewire (Mint uses pulseaudio) otherwise your stream won't pick up sound~~. (Edit: They have now added audio to screen sharing) You also don't get badges on the taskbar (the red dot) like you do on windows\n* RTX doesn't work on Hitman 3, probably not on other games\n* Sometimes a game may not start and I'd need to add launch options, takes 30 seconds if you go to the ProtonDB website\n* Installing mods may require extra launch options (e.g. beppinEx for Lethal Company) which can take a bit more time to find while your friends wait for you (i.e. abuse you for not using windows)\n* Age of Empires worked fine until I tried multiplayer and kept de-syncing, required some troubleshooting and ended up downloading a random .dll file from the internet.\n* Epic games didn't work for me, there is a client called Heroic Games Launcher that is supposed to help by integrating Wine, but when I tried to use it with EU4 it didn't work (the only game I tried)\n* ~~If your program crashes, force quitting can become a pain. On Windows I could use task manager to keep my programs in line, on Linux I believe you need to use terminal commands. Sometimes a program leaking memory like my 90 year old grandma would make me just restart the PC.~~ (System Monitor does the same thing as task manager) ^(thanks /u/Tagracat )\n\n**The Ugly**\n\n* The Adobe suite doesn't work on Linux, alternative FOSS software people talk about are not replacements if you use this software heavily. \n* Virtual Reality is a hot mess and is not going to support Linux any time soon, SteamVR worked but splurged errors everywhere, it also crashed every time I started Beatsaber, desktop view didn't work, front camera didn't work. I use an original HTC vive and apparently that is one of the few headsets supported on Linux (it's not) This is the only thing stopping me leaving windows behind forever.\n\n**The TLDR**\n\n* Steam good\n* Epic games not good\n* ~~Discord is rough around the edges~~\n* Adobe apps bad\n* Virtual Reality will save windows\n\nThanks for listening to my TED talk.",

A tiled nonsense, 2x control panels, forced updates and apps i cant delete with some trickery.\n\nThen 10 with its glorious cortana, spyware, forcing the new edge on me, it was just enough. I tried a few distributions, Manjaro was nice, Fedora i didnt take to, but Pop OS worked out the box, i like what they are doing and the pop shop.\n\nAt first the Pop shop reminded me of the play store, where the hell are all my hard drives?? Am i wasting precious fps or using sub par software... So many questions went through my head. If I'm honest i nuked my hard drive so many times and went back to windows.\n\nBut now its been 6 weeks and loving every minute. The pop shop, or software repo, is brilliant, one place and no hunting the net. Simple commands like update and upgrade to take care of all my apps. The Gnome disk utility was simple, mounting my hard drives wherever i please.\n\nGaming, well Proton is just magnificent, so easy!! I check the site, gold or higher seems to be effortless at most one command in launch options. And it runs generally on par with Windows, some native games such as Dota, CS and minecraft actually give me around 10% more fps than Windows.\n\nI have over 600 games and I'd say around 520 work in Linux, Lutris handles the rest with the ease of scripts.  I do miss a few anti cheat games if im honest but with the progress this may be a possibility in the future.\n\nIn terms of applications: Gimp, Krita, Inkscape, Kdenlive all have great potential, libre office or web apps for office.  Also i found Linux i'm way more productive and the workspaces is just genius!  Gnome tweaks and making my computer look and run how i want.\n\nAll in all, my computer is now my computer, Linux gives me that control back.  I just want to encourage others to give it a go, set aside a few weeks to persevere through any hurdles and i promise you, even if you go back to Windows... Linux will definitely make you see some positives. And sometimes notice like i do now how backwards some aspects of Windows actually are.",

    "body": "I have to prelude this by saying that I consider myself a generally competent end user.  I was raised in an OS-9 household and made the transition to Windows in middle school because I wanted to get in on some of that sweet Monkey Island action.  I know the install location of every program on my personal PC, I always run as Admin if the software doesn't work the first time, and I know how to google error codes and follow step-by-step instructions to make registry edits.  I don't really understand what's going on under the hood of my OS at any given time, but I am circumspect enough to do general troubleshooting.  For the most part, my computer and I get along fine.\n\nThat said, I've become more peripherally aware in the last year or so of the sort of money-grubbing bullshit Microsoft pulls (I know, I know; I'm young) and the bizarre, arbitrary restrictions they put on how users are allowed to use the OS.  The philosophy behind Linux is so comparatively enticing, even if for all practical purposes I really don't have the skills or interest to utilize the customization capabilities myself.  It's free, after all, so why not give Linux a try?  \n\nAnd, I mean, I did.  But even aside from the part where I managed to destroy my laptop's hard drive doing so (long story, not Mint's fault), I've left the experiment feeling very discouraged.\n\nThe thing I keep noticing over and over is that every guide which calls itself an \"intro to Linux\" or \"Linux for normal people\" or even \"Linux for Windows users\" seems geared toward users who are prepared to do deep work tinkering the OS itself (Bash, GNU, etc) rather than use the GUI as it's given.  Most of these guides start off with how to navigate the directory through the terminal, FFS.  I know it's a valuable skill to have, but I care a lot more about first learning to navigate the directory from the *desktop.*  \n\nI do not do network administration or development or coding.  Neither am I the sort of user who only checks their email and browses the internet.  I have a few particular programs I use very frequently (Manga Studio, MusicBee, Scrivener, a handful of non-AAA games) and my goal is to be able to continue to use them; I'm a simple woman.  I understand how the path through the Windows directory works, and I know how installation ties into that - you find a location in Program Files [(x86)] and there you put your executable and all related files, probably with a shortcut to the desktop.  If you want to keep backups for the save files of a game, find the default or custom location for those files and store them on an external drive or the cloud.  It comes very naturally after so many years using a PC.  Finding a simple but thorough \"compare and contrast\" introductory guide, however, one which uses Windows as a practical reference point for understanding Linux (\"you're used to having a C: drive, but Linux doesn't use that.  Instead, we have the root directory...\") has been surprisingly difficult.  I know that trying to understand one OS as a variation on the other isn't how you come to really comprehend how it works, but it would make me feel much steadier on my feet starting out.  It seems to me that those more foundational skills should come later.\n\nStupidly simple example question: Linux doesn't use .exe files, so does it have a direct equivalent?  Is there a default install location for software a la Program Files? If not, what does it do upon installing a new program instead?  How the heck does the whole process work?  And why am I struggling to find an easy-to-understand answer to this question?\n\nI don't know.  If you've made it this far into my long whine, you may be thinking that if the only reason I'm interested in moving to Linux is to make a statement, then it's really not for me, and that may very well be right.  I suppose I just wish that the community didn't keep throwing out the line that Linux is for everybody these days, and then begin every stable distro's introductory guide with how to navigate your files without a mouse.  Of course, if I have any fundamental misunderstandings about this, please say so.  I really am interested -- just overwhelmed.  Thanks for reading.\n\nEDIT: I really appreciate the feedback from everyone here.  I haven't had a chance to respond to every post, but I'm reading all of it.  You're all so encouraging!",

    "body": "&gt;Disclaimer: Potentially broken english ahead as this is not my native language, sorry for all the possibly nonsense sentences.\n\nThis is like my 23th attempt to make the definitive switch to linux and I'm doing everything I can to make this one right.\n\nMy laptop now runs Linux Mint XFCE with no issues, but my desktop was always the problem and the main reason I switched back to windows so many times.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5gfjeih56wvc1.png?width=697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7edb4e404cf2e06db9a6a38de38f2e5966aca4ce\n\nSo, in the past weeks I've had **a lot** of problems with linux mint, some of which I didn't find an explanation online, like:\n\n* Random sound cuts\n* PC unusable when installing games or heavy HDD work happened.\n* Desktop randomly signing out my session\n* Sometimes not having monitor signal\n* Random youtube framedrops\n\nI tried Linux Mint Cinnamon, Linux Mint Debian Edition, Linux Mint XFCE, Fedora (both gnome and KDE), Ubuntu, Arch (btw) and in every distro those problems were present sooner or later, at some point I thought that maybe was an Xorg or Wayland issue, later I considered maybe a pulseaudio/pipewire or alsa thing so I tried them all. And, the funny thing is, nothing of that happened on Windows, so the answer was pretty obvious... or was it?\n\nI was ready to give up once again, but after seeing Microsoft's plan to push even more the \"suggestions\" and ads on Windows, I tried to stick on linux and try to learn why all those problems were present to fix them.... just to fail epically soon after.\n\nAnyway, after an update which contained some kernel stuff, my pc started to show a couple of messages regarding  USB issues, messages that weren't there before.\n\nThings about some usb ports not starting correctly, so I read some sites and a lot of those problem were related to some BIOS configuration and faulty or damaged usb ports. Then I remembered one of my front usb ports didn't work well for a long time (I don't really use the front ports for some reasons). So I revisited the BIOS, saw that everything was fine, the problem was still there.\n\nSo I unplugged everything, started to check all my usb ports one by one, all of the back ones were perfectly fine, but one of the front seemed damaged, so I unplugged the front ports from the motherboard to see if that fixed anything.\n\nAnd well... all seem to work now.\n\nNo USB issues, not random sound cuts nor video cuts, not system slowdowns, it looks like just.... it just works.\n\nI know more issues will rise as I'll use this everyday (like tha fact that cinnamon for some reason decides to force my keyboard to english and don't show me \"Latinamerican spanish\" as an option, just \"spanish\"), but I don't know what could have happen if I just switched back to windows and ignored that hardware issue.\n\nLinux forced me to read, to learn and to fix something that could potentially made a bigger problem in the future.\n\n  \nUpdate: Well, the video/audio cuts are still present, but that's the only issue right now and a very little small price to pay.\n\nI've been playing GTA IV and the cut itself is much smaller than a second, is noticeable because of the audio cut, but it doesn't affect the gameplay, and it's weird, it can happen after 20 seconds or after 20 minutes, it doesn't matter if I'm playing something heavy or just watching some random video on youtube.\n\nBut that aside, I'm feeling very confortable with the system and it stays.",

I started work in a new field this year (computational chemistry) and was told by everyone in my office that I shouldn't use windows, that I should switch to linux. I asked which distro and was told to use Ubuntu unanimously by everyone in the office. Since I'm working from home, and my pc is on Windows 10, I've been using Ubuntu 20.04 on a Hyper-V VM.\n\nThe problem I've having is that I'm supposed to be getting work done, but instead I spend hours battling my OS and troubleshooting. Things that I assume should be simple such as installing a program take me hours or days to figure out. There's about 50 different ways of installing programs on linux and I can never know which one is correct for the program I'm currently installing/trying to use. Of course any info when I google the problem the info is years out of date and doesn't work anymore. Not to mention everyone always assumes you have at least some rudimentary knowledge of how linux works. So I end up spending hours trying to learn how linux works, instead of just using linux to do my work.\n\nI'm extremely frustrated and losing my head, I found myself screaming at my computer which I've never done before in my life. Every single thing I want to do requires me googling it, spending ages reading outdated askubuntu pages, then ending up asking a new question on askubuntu and just hoping someone helps me out (which I would appreciate tremendously), which just doesn't happen, 6 questions asked over the past few months and no answers. And then when I ask a question and try move on to solving some other issue I have, askubuntu tells me I have to wait 40mins between asking questions. So I'm using these 40mins to blow off some steam and have a rant here.\n\nNot sure what to do other than power through this learning period. Thanks for reading my rant.\n\ntl;dr I'm spending more time battling my OS than using it.",

    "title": "Want to learn how Linux works and the commands to use the command line effectively in your day-to-day? I'm putting out a tutorial series on just that.",
    "body": "Hey guys,\n\nfirst of all, let me introduce myself. My name is Mislav Jurić and I'm a recent computer science master's degree graduate. I am interested in AI, tech startups and software engineering.\n\nI first started using Linux on my computer about 2 years ago and I'm still using it. Albeit I have used Linux for 2 years, for the first year and a half I was using Linux mostly through GUI and everything I didn't understand I would Google. Googling stuff is OK, I've got nothing against it, but I didn't have the foundational knowledge of how Linux actually worked under the hood. I didn't know what the commands in the tutorial I found on Google were doing to my operating system.\n\nWhen I started working as a software engineer (there I also used Linux), I decided it was time for me to learn how Linux works and the basic commands that would be very useful to know. I read three books for that purpose:\n\n* Barrett, D. J. (2016). *Linux pocket guide* (3rd ed.). O’Reilly Media.\n* Shotts, W. (2019). *The Linux Command Line, Fifth Internet Edition*. Retrieved from [http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php](http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php)\n* Ward, B. (2014). *How Linux Works: What Every Superuser Should Know* (2nd ed.). No Starch Press.\n\nAfter reading those books, I had the knowledge of the foundational concepts of the Linux operating system. I am by no means an expert, but I think I know the basics.\n\nI thought to myself: \"Hey, there are probably people out there dealing with this situation as well.\". So I made a Linux Tutorial Series primarily aimed at people completely new to Linux and for software engineers who have never used Linux before. You can find it [here](http://www.mislavjuric.com/category/linux-tutorial-series/). I've got both written and video version of it (video resides on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAiVTP4ez4s&amp;list=PLyscv5D4FoIi1CU_HsV1j1QPafNSlY0dJ)). The tutorial series has some videos where I explain fundamental operating system concepts. I think that in order to understand Linux well, you need to understand the basics of how operating systems work. If you're a software engineer, you can glance over those parts, but for people that haven't got a computer science background... Well, you're in for a treat!\n\nAs I said, I don't deem myself an expert in Linux. For that reason, I created [Linux Stories](http://www.mislavjuric.com/category/linux-stories/), which is a podcast where I bring in guests who have been using Linux for longer than me. It's a supplement to the Linux Tutorial Series and it's there if people ever want to go farther than the Linux Tutorial Series will take them. ([YouTube link to Linux Stories playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRXCaArl8WE&amp;list=PLyscv5D4FoIi5D6sXURtDnW4y75nhr8nv)). I also post some content unrelated to Linux, such as a podcast around AI, startups and software engineering called [Interesting Conversations with Mislav Jurić](http://www.mislavjuric.com/category/interesting-conversations-with-mislav-juric/). This is my personal brand, so I'm putting out content related to everything I'm interested in.\n\nI am present on various social media platforms, as you can see from [my website](http://www.mislavjuric.com/).  Feel free to follow me on any social media platform you find convenient. My preference is YouTube and my newsletter. Although I've never sent out a newsletter before, I want to do it only when I have something juicy and interesting, such as a really cool podcast episode or a very thoughtfully written blog post. Don't worry about getting thousands of boring emails - I hate that too.\n\nI hope you find this useful!\n\nBest,  \nMislav",

Me and my friend has been thinking about trying out Linux for a very long time now, it's just that we didn't care enough to actually try it out. But then after Felix built his first PC, he installed Linux Mint on that thing and Arch Linux on his laptop and saw how cool it is to customize your own desktop and everything and I thought maybe I should try it out. I mean there is nothing to lose if I try it out.\n\nNow I know that Linux Mint is RECOMMENDED for beginners trying out Linux, but for me, I really wanted to try out Arch Linux no matter how hard it is. I'm planning on Dual-booting it with my old extra HDD that's installed in my PC (I have 2 other SSDs btw), I just don't know how to do it.\n\n=====\n\nEDIT: WIth all things considered. I decided to go with what the comments say. I'll try out Linux Mint first because that's what Felix did before moving to Arch Linux and see where I go from there. Still worried about the Dual Booting though.\n\n=====\n\nEDIT 2: I have successfully installed Linux into my old spare HDD with ease. Create a Flash Media or something like then flash it using balenaEtcher, then Live Boot off of that, then from there you can choose to try it out or install directly there. If you did choose to install it from Live Boot, it's a pretty straightforward proccess, it's like installing a program from Windows, just be careful which drive you mount your Linux from. It also downloads GRUB for you so Dual-Booting is already solved.",

One day, suddenly I’ve realized that Windows and OS X  are both full of **bloatware**  which I find really annoying, primarily because I like everything to be  perfectly aligned in the order I want it to be. After a little bit of  googling on the internet I’ve found many interesting operating systems  which were available for me, but none of them seemed as a long term  project which will continue to grow, except a few similar ones. From my  computer experience I’ve been listening to people talking about Linux  Kernel, but I didn’t want to know much about it. Time has passed, and  I’ve finally picked one which I liked. And it’s name is **Ubuntu**.  I know that many people are going to complain about my choice, which is  probably the most common one, but don’t get me wrong, Fedora and  Mint(another Ubuntu, I know) would have made me satisfied if they had  more appealing user interface. And here the journey begins.\n\n## Preparing for a switch\n\nI  couldn’t listen to people talking about Virtual Machines running Linux  as it is not what I wanted. I knew it wasn’t able to handle neither 3D  nor 2D game development and design. I’ve started diving into deep waters  straight from the beginning. Since I’m a programmer, as I’ve mentioned  earlier, I’m used to running both Windows and Mac OS. Therefore I had to  use a dual-boot computer as my daily driver, which I enjoyed. So I did  have a lot of dual-booting, triple-booting or even quad-booting  experience. I downloaded one third party USB Disk creation tool and put  an ISO onto it and went through installer step by step. I thought I was  up and running, there is only a few other software left to install, yet  the simplest thing in my life, huh. No. Lots of things were going bad  from the start. WiFi is working, I suppose, well at least there is icon  indicating it on the top, well it kinda works. OK, I say, maybe it’s my  adapter so I’ll have some trouble in future, but who cares, I think,  there’s a whole lot of new stuff to figure out. At this point I hope  that all the necessary software is installed, like on my Mac or Windows.\n\n## Whole, lot trouble in front of me\n\nI’ve  tried to use my PC but I see something is going wrong, I’ve got a  $1,500 worth PC and it can’t even play a 720p video. I’ve messed up  something for sure. I test my WiFi speed an it’s 1.5 megabit per second,  wow, I say it can’t be, on OS X it is nearly ten times faster! I’ve got  to fix this, I say. I google up a bit on the internet and find out that  I’ve got one of the least supported adapters which is knows for being  messy. OK, I’ll try some online guides. I’m going all over the internet  and trying, trying, trying… But no use. It seems as if my Linux journey  is coming to an end. And from nowhere I get an e-mail that my Ubuntu  Forum Thread has finally gotten a reply. And he is able to solve my  problem using open source drivers. Yup, I’ve finally got good internet  speeds, let’s give Youtube a try. Now 720p videos play, kinda, there’s a  lot of lag in them. Oh, I see! My GPU driver is not installed, let’s  fix it. I open up AMD website, look up my HD6970 and I find some  downloadable .tar.gz files. OK, some more troubleshooting and I’ve found  the install.sh file. I run through the wizard and it fails with some  stupid error (AMD, don’t be shit). Well, I guess I’ll need some open  source drivers I guess. I find some Barts drivers and install them and I  get pretty good results, obviously not as good as on Windows or OS X,  but pretty close. Now, my computer is able to handle both 3D and 2D  rendering which is great! Now, I’m more of a private guy so I try to set  up a DNS server, but it again ain’t work. Brhhh, I hate you Linux! But  again after some troubleshooting, changing repositories and installing  different WiFi manager app I get it to work.\n\n## Installing the important software\n\nNow,  that I’ve met Linux a bit, I know that it’s not like Windows, which  provides you with installation wizards, but more like a database  including all needed software in repositories. I got used to it and I’m  starting to like it :). Now it’s time to throw some software on it.  After a little time, I got all of my daily apps installed, which  included VLC Media Player, Libre Office, Firefox and Addons, Filezilla  and some other apps. Now it’s time to start building apps and games, I  say. I open Unity website and look for Unity 3 installer, but there is  no Linux option. Somewhere on the internet I find Unity installer which  was ported to Linux and download it as .deb file. Everything is up and  running except my graphics apps. I’m more of the **Adobe**  guy, so I liked Adobe CS4 Master Collection, eventually I realized that  it’s not available on Linux. Remember running .exe on OS X? Well **Wine**  runs in ans saves the day again! Installing and activating Adobe apps  isn’t much of a deal and Illustrator, Photoshop, Fireworks and  Dreamwaver are here. Again, as with benchmarks, performance isn’t  perfect but can still do the job. Finally I’ve gotten all of the needed  apps with the exception for Visual Studio which hasn’t been ported to  neither Mac nor Linux, and situation for Linux hasn’t changed today  (unlike with Mac).\n\n## Customizing Ubuntu, making it kinda appealing\n\nBack  in the days, Windows was customizable, with a little bit of tweaking  registry you could have made it just the way you wanted, unlike today.  Linux was more of OS which was just starting to gain fame, even though  it was over ten years old. Ubuntu lacked in app themes, icon packs,  shell themes etc. I’ve found some wallpapers online and made them  shuffle on the desktop again with the help of open source apps. Icon  packs were available but I found them more beautiful than on windows,  because of unity’s squared icons, so everything seemed nice and clean.  Lack of animations made me a proud Linux user, as everything felt  snappier than on other platforms. The only problem that I really had,  was that my desktop was zoomed in a bit, not much but about 3–4 pixels. I  found a solution in terminal and even though my monitor had a bit of  the black bars it was better.\n\n## Learning Shell\n\nTerminal,  your Linux’ best friend is basically like a command prompt if you’ve  never used Unix based OS like Mac OS. It wasn’t much of a change for me,  because I’ve had some Terminal knowledge but actually on my Mac Pro, I  used mostly Windows. I had to get used to using **sudo** (windows calls it Admin), apt, dpkg, git etc. If you’re planning to switch to Linux, the best way of preparing would be **Chocolatey**.  If you have ever used Sublime Text, you will probably know what I’m  talking about. Most of the users won’t need to know many commands, only  about fifteen commands. There’s also a good blog that covers many topics  about Linux called **It’sFOSS**, which I highly recommend.\n\n## What I got after switching to Linux\n\nAt  first it seemed as a completely new but useless experience as most of  the things I’ve been doing were able to be done on Windows or Mac OS,  but after some time I got to like some things about Linux. First of all  and one of the key things, it’s completely **free** and **open-source**  (except for some of distros). This feature really stands out in the  world of operating systems. There is source available for many apps and  operating systems, so you can customize them just the way you want and  be able to pack them into an ISO disk image, which I really appreciate,  so that all of my software can come preinstalled. Another useful thing  is that as a tech geek I’ve come across many risky websites. I’ve gotten  viruses or malware from there sometimes on Windows even though I can  recognize them and delete them immediately, but on Linux situation is a  bit different. Virus software is unable to make any mess without root  permission, which I must grant it, therefore it can’t damage my  operating system. Throughout the years, Linux has gotten great app  support for developers and designers, and all of them are stored in one  place. Apps like Visual Studio Code, Atom Text Editor, Android Studio  and many more are stored in Snaps library and those can be easily  installed within 2–3 commands. Another great thing which I like about  Linux is **no existence of installation wizards**.  I know that Wizards help newbies in installation process, but  disagreeing and agreeing with bunch of stupid statements and installing  bloatware is waste of time for me. Linux has also become my Home Server.  I can share all of my photos, videos, documents, downloads etc. It has  become like a cloud server with a few lifetime terabytes of storage.  Linux has also fixed my **HDD** boot times, as it is quite a lightweight operating system, so that I don’t need to store OS on my SSD.\n\n## What I miss in Linux\n\nPersonally,  I’ve been a fanboy for many years. At first I really liked Apple, after  that I started to like Microsoft and I’ve become a Linux fanboy in last  couple of years. I’ve made many compromises when using Linux and have  switched from many industry standard software to free alternatives, but  still there are some software packages that can’t be changed. Wine has  made my Linux life a lot easier but still **Video Editing**  software hasn’t been ported to Linux. Adobe Premiere always fails to  render and Magix (primarily Sony) Vegas hasn’t still been ported to  Wine. There are still some alternative software available fir you such  as DaVinci Resolve and Kdenlive. DaVinci Resolve has been used for color  correction in the film industry for quite a long time now and now it  packs more features focused on professional video editing. My all time  best IDE Visual Studio can’t manage to run in virtual machine nor Wine.  Therefore I still have to use Windows to run it in dual boot. Another  big minus in Linux is no existence of **.NET**  framework, but Mono project which doesn’t seem nearly as functional as  Microsoft’s option. Another tool I miss is a MPC-HC which is in my  opinion one of the best media players, which produces the best colors in  video playback.\n\n## Should you switch to Linux?\n\nUsually  at this point people will tell you that it is totally up to you and  that they can’t know answer to questions of this type. I’m going to give  you a few tips that will help you with making your choice. First of all  you should decide whether you want to install Linux on the computer you  already own or buy a new PC. If your choice is to install it on  computer you already own, I recommend looking up drivers online before  starting an installation. If your PC uses Intel HD graphics or Nvidia  graphics chip, low DPI monitor and Ethernet cable, you are already good  to go, whereas if your PC uses **AMD graphics card**, **high DPI** monitor and **Wireless**  adapter you should look them up in this way : Series name for GPU (for  example Turks), Monitor Model and Wireless Adapter Chip (for exaple  Rtl8192 not Netis 2116). Otherwise if you choice is to buy new PC, don’t buy PC made for Windows, look for parts that are Linux supported.Once  you’ve found out that your parts are Linux supported, you should pick  right distribution for you. Some of most popular and most supported are  Linux Mint, Fedora, CentOS, Ubuntu, Lubuntu, Arc Linux, Parrot Linux,  Puppy Linux etc. For a system administrator I would recommend going for a  Linux Mint, for developers Ubuntu or Arc, for lower powered PCs Lubuntu  or Puppy Linux, for those who care for privacy Parrot is my No. 1.If you plan mostly **gaming**  on Linux, the solution has been released recently. There is a tool on  GitHub called DXVK. It is still not that stable, but stable enough to  run most titles in Wine.**Cross-platform app developers** shouldn’t switch to Linux in my opinion as it doesn’t support leading frameworks, but if you plan to do **Javascript**, **Ruby**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **Java** or even **C#**  game development I would highly recommend it. There are all of the  needed tools, you can run your databases and secure them much easier  then on Windows or Mac.What about **hacking**?  Well short answer, yes and no. Hacking is quite complex and not  everybody can be hacker. Linux is a good base for starting hacking. **Debian** and any other Debian based operating system can be used for this purpose, but many people recommend **Kali Linux** or **Parrot Linux**.  This choice is often made because they come bundled with many  “security” software which will be used for hacking :). Now many of you  will download and install Kali, but you are not hackers, there’s a long  way in front of you, I would recommend learning how Databases and  Networking work but programming knowledge can come in handy. You must  always remember that online guides will teach you useful skills, but  taking down a website will take quite some time of studying, huh.**HTPC (Home Theater Personal Computer)** can  run pretty well on Linux based operating system. If you plan on  building a home theater personal computer, I would suggest also building  a home server. There you will be able to store all of your “legally”  downloaded movies, music, photos etc. It also has wide support of HTPC  apps like **Kodi**.**Mining on Linux?**  Mining has become a trend in last few years and it is an interesting  topic, but on Linux… I don’t think so. Graphics units are currently the  most profitable way of mining and many of them have worse performance  than on Windows, so if profit is your main goal than avoid Linux. Mining  a less popular coin may sound interesting to you, so in this case Linux  is your best friend, as many developers start small nowadays on **GitHub**.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLinux  is a user friendly operating system which is trying to get its  attention, but maybe it’s time just hasn’t come yet. Power users may  find it difficult that there are no their favorite apps, but still there  are free alternatives which may fit your needs. Switching to it made me  a favor, as there are no more annoying Windows apps which many of you  didn’t even know existed, so I’m finally free of bloatware.If you found this article helpful please consider sharing and commenting and as always keep safe until next time :).I  want to thank all of you who supported me on Reddit r/Linux4Noobs and I  want to give big thanks to people who made this article possible : [u/Wojakusesarch](https://www.reddit.com/user/Wojakusesarch) | [u/aikilink](https://www.reddit.com/user/aikilink) | [u/frankandgalculator](https://www.reddit.com/user/frankandgalculator) | [u/metmike07](https://www.reddit.com/user/metmike07) | [u/redditandom](https://www.reddit.com/user/redditandom/) | [u/Cactoos](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cactoos/) | [u/tdreampo](https://www.reddit.com/user/tdreampo/) | [u/takethecannoli4](https://www.reddit.com/user/takethecannoli4)",

    "title": "Thinking of switching? Tips from a user of 26 years.",
    "body": "I see lots of posts here from people considering switching to Linux. As someone who has used Linux exclusively since '98 I think I'm qualified to list a few pointers:\n\n1. Don't think that you can convert overnight. If your computer is important or is used for critical tasks either use a different one for your initial Linux adventures or at least make backups and install Linux on a separate partition.\n\n2. Don't make it harder than it has to be. I'd bet the majority of people that end up going back to their old OS do so because they made Linux harder than necessary for themselves.\n\n3. Don't try to do it all at once. Just get comfortable with the way Linux works for a start. It's totally different to Windows under the hood but it's also transparent so you can see how it works. Read about it, snoop the filesystem, get familiar with it. Don't worry too much about radical customization or learning 15 programming languages until you feel at home.\n\n4. Don't use a particular distro because it's what the \"cool kids\" use or because it's the flavour of the month. I'm looking at you Arch, and all your bastard offspring. Use a mainstream, mature distro that uses a mainstream, mature packaging system. These kinds of distros also tend to have better forum support. Don't bother replying in defence of Arch or any other niche distros, I don't care what you think.\n\n5. There's nothing worse than a distro that works fine until you go to upgrade or install new software, when you find it craps out because of missing packages or a dependency or an offline repository. Or maybe the repo is up but hasn't been updated. In my not-at-all-humble opinion you should only be considering distros that are either Debian or Red Hat based. The Debian based ones include Ubuntu, Mint, MX and others. The best known RedHat based distro is Fedora. Personally I have always found the Debian distros to be rock solid with zillions of available packages, and the apt based installers to be extremely reliable. With Mint or MX you don't normally have to enable any extra repositories.\n\n6. My recommended choice for a newby is always Mint. Debian based, reliable and solid, very good hardware detection, huge repositories and solid package management. It requires little to no fettling out of the box. MX is also very good and is a little snappier.\n\n7. Don't get sucked into using the fanciest whiz-bang desktop environment you can find for your first installation. Just get something simple like XFCE, Mate or maybe Gnome for a start. Get the feel for Linux first, then you can spend as much time as you like customizing the ultimate desktop.\n\n8. Don't ask for help on Reddit (yes, I know). Go to the forum of your chosen distro, you'll get better advice there. This place is full of snot nosed kids. Google any problems you might encounter; it's almost certain others have had the same problem and have found solutions. I'm gobsmacked by the quantity of questions asked here by people who have obviously spent zero effort on even the most rudimentary web search. Helping yourself is easy.\n\n9. Linux distros are almost trivially easy to download and install. Most can be run from a USB stick. The beauty of this is that you can see if you like a distro and check its hardware detection without having to install it (known as running a live session). If you like it you can generally install it from within a live session. A handy source of info on many many distros is the distrowatch web site. There are lots of info there on many different distros but remember point 4: avoid the obscure distros.\n\n10. For the first few months at least, treat your Linux partition as experimental. In other words don't use it to store important stuff. Sometimes the first distro you try doesn't quite do everything you want so don't be shy about trying something different. Besides it's fun to see how other distros do things. When you are satisfied with your distro and desktop environment then you can make it your everyday workhorse.\n\nThat'll do for now.",

    "body": "I’m a long time lurker in this sub and just wanted to say a quick thank you to everyone who posts here!\n\nTldr: Working in IT support (Windows), RHEL server P1 came in on Friday afternoon, no Linux guys around. Manager gave me a shot at it. Resolved!\n\nSo I’ve been working in IT support for a couple of years (entirely Windows based) and just started on a 2nd line team. \nThis Friday my manager got a call from another team panicking that a client’s app was down and all their Linux guys were either sick or on leave and did he know anyone who could help. \n\nHe knew that I’d been learning Linux so sent  them to me.\n\nAfter a few minutes getting credentials sorted, and suddenly I’m loose on a prod Red Hat app server 😅\nThankfully the Linux guys had documented the crap out of things and I was able to locate and restart the borked service pretty quickly. \n\nNeedless to say, both managers were really happy and said I’m going to be getting more Linux tickets coming my way from now on 😊\n\nI know it was only a simple thing but I’d never have gotten to this point without the help and advice posted here and the other *nix boards.\n\nSo once again, thanks, you guys are awesome!",
