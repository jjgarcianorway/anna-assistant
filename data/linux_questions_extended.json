    "body": "I gave it about 63 days before I gave up on it. 60 days ago I thought it was awesome. The past 2 weeks it was just annoying. When it became a bootable iso image I was pretty sure they were going to lose me. I didn't want a new distro. I wanted Arch with a a preconfigured Hyprland and development environment.\n\nI think it is kind of funny/sad how the mindset is is break free from your Mac and then they give you a version of Arch that is becoming more and more Mac like in the sense that you need to use Alacritty if you want these tui's to work right, and their modified chromium if you want these web apps to work right. And, oh I see you changed your keybinds, we're going to just change those back even though you did it the way we suggested. DHH has come up with some newer ones and you'll probably like them better than yours.  What? It changes your whole workflow? Funny you should mention that because we're also going to replace your neovim settings too. You might as well just do things our way.\n\nYeah I know it is an opinionated install, I didn't realize it was going to be opinionated updates as well. Just not for me. I did get some benefit from using it. I discovered lazygit and a few other terminal based applications.\n\nSo now that I am back to a fresh Arch install I figured I would give Cosmic a go. I must say I am pretty impressed with it. I like being able to set tiling or floating per work space.\n\n\\*edit\\*\n\nI had a 2nd PC with Omarchy installed, a little HP Mini. I ended up removing Omarchy tonight and keeping my Arch install by doing the following steps.\n\nDisable the Omarchy seamless login service and renable tty1\n\n    sudo systemctl stop omarchy-seamless-login.service\n    sudo systemctl daemon-reload \n    sudo systemctl start getty@tty1.service\n\nIt is easier if you log in on tty2 (ctrl-alt f2) to do this, When you stop the seamless login service it might kick you to a black screen. Once you get rid of the auto login you can also remove the omarchy decryption graphic and replace it with something prettier. You only need to do this if you are using an encrypted disk. If you aren't using LUKS just skip to the .config folder part.\n\n\"plymouth-set-default-theme -l\" will show a list of the themes. I went with bgrt which is basically the spinner theme with your bios or PC manufacturer's boot logo. You need to make sure you specify the -R flag so it will rebuild the initramfs.\n\n    sudo plymouth-set-default-theme -R bgrt\n\nAt this stage I decided to just move my .config folder and start with a fresh one. You don't have to do this part. If you decide to keep your .config folder and keep hyprland, there is a pretty good chance it will get updated back to omarchy again.\n\n    cd \n    mv .config/ .config.bak \n    mkdir .config\n\nThen I just copied over folders I wanted to preserve and omitted things I didn't mind rebuilding from scratch. Below are just some examples. One thing of note. Omarchy symlinks the themes to a lot of their stuff so if you copy nvim or any of your terminal customizations you might want to consider copying the omarchy folder. At the time of writing this, it only has a themes folder and a current theme folder.\n\n    cd .config\n    cp -r ../.config.bak/chromium .\n    cp -r ../.config.bak/retroarch .\n    cp -r ../.config.bak/nvim .\n\nYou can reboot here. You should get a new plymouth screen with the Arch logo at the bottom and whatever theme you picked\n\nFinally you need to get rid of the omarchy mirror and update your mirror list.\n\n    sudo nvim /etc/pacman.conf\n\nscroll down and comment out or remove these lines.\n\n    [omarchy] \n    SigLevel = Optional TrustAll \n    Server = https://pkgs.omarchy.org/$arch\n\nSave it and then run this to rebuild your mirror list\n\n    sudo pacman -Syyu\n\nAt this point you just need to do one more thing, remove omarchy-chromium\n\n    sudo pacman -R omarchy-chromium\n\nYou can re-install the real Chromium if you want it. Having the omarchy fork there will be problematic if you ever want to update Chromium.\n\nNow you are free to install whatever desktop and window manager you would like to use. If you install SDDM you can set that to auto login and go right into whatever you install.\n\nOmarchy is still going to exist in .local/share/omarchy as a git repo. I am keeping it there so I can cannibalize their themes. :)\n\nI hope this proves useful to some people and gets you back to just using Arch btw.",

While the Installation guide is pretty good, there's several little things you probably should do to your system after install, or right now if you never done it before.\n\n* Bootloader\n\nYou should enable automatic updates for your specific bootloader.\n\nSystemd-boot - https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-boot#Automatic_update\n\nGrub - https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GRUB#Warning_to_perform_grub-install/grub-mkconfig_at_each_grub_update\n\nFor others check https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_boot_process\n\n* Locale\n\nIf you use your system in English  but lives outside the US you should set up your locale.conf accordingly, ex.\n\n    LANG=de_DE.UTF-8\n    LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8\n    LC_COLLATE=C.UTF-8\n\n\nIn my case `LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8` guarantee while the system is in English, while `LANG=en_DE.UTF-8` makes that all the other settings are set up to the local German standards.\n\nLC_COLLATE=C.UTF-8 is recommended to be set as `C.UTF-8` by the wiki.\n\nThere's also several other variables that can be set individually but are probably not necessary for the vast majority of people.\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Locale\n\n^Shoutout ^to ^/u/legacynl\n\n* Trim\n\nEnable Trim on your SSDs, either with the discard mount option if you drive and file system support it or using the fstrim.service.\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Solid_state_drive#TRIM\n\n* Makepkg\n\nIf you're constantly using AUR packages you should enable makepkg optimizations. \n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Makepkg#Optimization\n\n* Fonts\n\nInstall the noto-fonts-cjk (or other CJK font pack) so you don't see a bunch of empty squares when people use Chinese Japanese or Korean characters.\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fonts\n\n* Mirrors\n\nInstall and set up Reflector service to keep your mirrors up to date \n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Reflector\n\n* .pacnew\n\nPackage updates will often generate .pacnew files, those files are new config files that have new options or new standards and need to be dealt with promptly. What I do is just run\n\n `$ pacman -Syu &amp;&amp; pacdiff` \n\nand I deal with them immediately, or you can just run \n\n`$ pacdiff` \n\nonce in a while. Not dealing with .pacnew files might cause you problems in the future.\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman/Pacnew_and_Pacsave\n\n* Package cache\n\nClean your package cache periodically so you don't end up with several GB of packages just sitting around.\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman#Cleaning_the_package_cache\n\n* Zram\n\nYou should probably update your old SWAP partiton to Zram, it's better in every way possible, the only caveat is hibernation, I don't use it and I don't know if it's possible to use Zram and still have hibernation.\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Zram\n\nThere's certainly more stuff that I can't think of right now, but leave your tips and I'll update the post with the best ones.",

I like challenges and they thought \"why not jump into cold Waters.\"  \n\nI started installing It on an VM, you know just to get started. Later I found out 90% of my issues were caused by said VM and not by Arch itself. Lol\n\nSure I spent like 2 hours to get it running like I wanted to. Sure I had to read the wiki a shitton. But my god the wiki. I love the wiki so much. Genuinely I'm convinced if you just READ arch isn't that bad. Everything is explained, and everything has links that explain the stuff that isn't explained. \n\nAnd the best part about my 2 hours slamming my keyboard with button inputs to put everything in FOOT (don't judge, I couldn't get kitty to run, and when I was finally able to run it foot kinda looked nice to me lol)... Now I understand every inch of my system. Not like in windows where honestly most registry files are still a mystery to me. No! I've spent so much time in the wiki and hammering in the same commands over and over and editing configs that I understand every tiny little detail of my system. I see something I don't like and know how to change it, or at least I know how to find out how to change it. (The wiki most times lol)\n\nAnd don't even get me started about Pacman. Jesus fucking Christ I've never had fun installing programs in windows before. Pacman is just no bs, get me to where I need to be. (Similarly to KDE Discover, but I've heard it's not so nice since it keeps infos from Pacman, oh well, pacman is good enough even without gui)\n\nThe entire experience was just fun.

Installed Arch Linux + Hyprland again with the help of Arch wiki, success!]\n\nI see a lot of noobs asking the simplest questions in certain subreddits which is justified because well, they are noobs. I was a noob too, actually I'm still a noob and I'm learning about linux. I've come across numerous YouTube videos, blogs and articles about 'linuxing' but none of them clicked. I started out with Debian and really liked how Linux worked without any abstractions. \n\nI dived into the world of linux distro and learned about distro hopping quickly. But at this point I didn't know jackshit about linux, I only used it as a newbie. \n\nEver since I laid my eyes on Arch, I was determined to make Arch my own ('my own' as in being the power user Arch actually expects. Sorry my vocabulary limits me from using more sophisticated words as English is not my first language and I can't put my real feelings behind these words). Also there's this cool prestige among people that Arch Linux users are just better. So I typed 'Arch Linux' on my browser, visited the official website and installed the ISO. And of course, I chose to go with the hardest path i.e, manual installation. Guess what? I failed miserably and I couldn't really understand what was happening behind the hood. I felt defeated and chose to switch to EndeavourOS KDE because I wanted to try out Arch without having to deal with the hassle of installation. \n\n6 months later, I decided that it was time to install arch with hyprland. But this time, I had knowledge about the archinstall script. I installed Arch with no issues at all. This time though, there was another issue. Hyprland. I had no fucking clue about what I was balls deep in. In the end, I failed again.\n\nI had to restore my EndeavourOS setup with Timeshift(thank God I had created a backup earlier). I decided to try again but this time I was determined and clicked every single link I came across while reading the Arch Wiki. I mean yes, it took me a lot of time to install the OS but guess what? I actually knew what I was doing this time. Oh and btw I did all of this in gnome-boxes because I was scared of breaking my system. Now I just gotta do this again which won't take much time ;).\n\nBasically my point in writing this huge ass article is that please stop searching for easier alternatives such as YouTube videos and go read the Arch Wiki. There's tons of information in there and many more I still haven't discovered yet! You'll find everything you seek about Arch and Linux in general in there.\n\nI'll post the screenshots of my setup in the comments after I install Arch on my laptop.\n\nThanks for reading!",

Windows still went behind my back and nuked my TPM state, which makes Arch refuse to boot due to TPM measurement inconsistency.\n\nAnd the cherry on top: I did have a passphrase… but I was smart enough to throw away the note after saving it into KeePassXC inside the same encrypted system. So now I’m locked out by my own genius.\n\nLesson learned:\n\n* Always keep a backup passphrase outside the system.\n* If you value your sanity, never install Windows after Linux.\n* Or just… don’t use Windows at all or put it inside a VM.

    "body": "I used to wonder why people complicate things instead of embracing simplicity, especially Arch Linux users. Why would anyone want to manage everything themselves?\n\nMy Linux journey began three years ago during my Software Engineering degree, starting with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) running Debian. Initially, using the terminal as my daily driver was intimidating. Later, I switched completely to Ubuntu and grew more comfortable. I discovered Neovim and fell in love with it - kudos to the Vim creators!\n\nThe hype around Arch kept catching my attention. After some research, I discovered it centered around Arch's DIY philosophy. Curiosity got the better of me, so I decided to give it a shot in a VM first.\n\nI spent about a week learning the installation process through the ArchWiki, Reddit, and some AI assistance. As I dove deeper, each new term led me down fascinating rabbit holes of knowledge. The Wiki's structure is brilliant - it guides you while encouraging exploration of related concepts. I can confidently say the ArchWiki is the finest documentation I've encountered on the internet. It's not just documentation; it's a masterpiece.\n\nDuring this process, I created my own documentation in Obsidian, and ultimately gained a deep understanding of the GNU/Linux system. When I finally installed Arch on my actual machine, I barely needed to reference anything (except for a post-installation audio issue) - it all came naturally.\n\nI now understand that truly knowing Linux comes from building and maintaining your system yourself. To all Arch users out there: instead of just saying \"I use Arch btw,\" I'll say \"I love Arch btw!\" Much respect to the GNU/Linux creators, Arch maintainers, Wiki contributors, and the entire community.\n\nArch BTW, forever!",

One of my subjects requires me to compile a micro OS called XINU which was built on an ancient build of gcc. Having access to old versions of gcc through the AUR saved me soo much time. I was able to build and test locally without using the slow university servers.\n\n2. Another course requires me to write mpi programs to implement parallel algos and installing openmpi, running the programs across various cores was seamless. Unlike my friend who has an M1 pro macbook, I did not have to fiddle with any settings or break my head in figuring out why the code was not compiling.\n\n3. My operating system course also had in depth studies on how linux works and using linux gave me an easy way to see real world examples of how linux scheduling, memory management and threading works.\n\nAll of these may seem minor, but they were huge time savers and helped me focus on coding rather than fighting with the OS.

This way you’re not even afraid of setting up something I.e secure boot that might your brick your pc in the process. Having a spare arch Linux install on a drive is a must and learn how the different log files.

    "title": "The most complex Archlinux setup I’ve done",
    "body": "The setup contains the following:\n\n* Archlinux + KDE\n* BTRFS File System with Timeshift Snapshots\n* LUKS Encryption\n* Unified Kernel Images\n* systemd Boot\n* Secure Boot with TPM 2 auto-unlock\n* Dual Boot with Windows with Bitlocker enabled\n* SWAP as a File\n* Recovery UKI and BTRFS Snapshot UKI using the LTS Kernel\n* Hardware: Lenovo L560 with Intel i5 and 16GB of RAM\n\n\tSome background to all of this: This my second time installing Archlinux. First time was a minimal bare-bones setup, using GRUB and no security measures. It was still a dual-boot setup with Windows, but no Secure Boot, no TPM and no Encryption, on either OS-es. Basically, it was just a familiarization with Linux and how it works.\n\n\tBut I loved it! The granularity with which an OS can be manipulated and configured, the privacy, the efficiency. It was all astonishing, especially when coming from a life of using Windows (since 1998).\n\n\tThere were still a lot of boxes I wanted to check. Learning about File Systems, CoW, Snapshots, Unified Kernel Images, UEFI, Secure Boot, TPM2, SWAP, Kernels, and many other things. Diving a bit deeper into how an OS works. I believe that with this setup I mostly managed to do that.\n\n\tI’m going to describe a bit of the most interesting particularities of this setup:\n\n**BTRFS File System with Timeshift Snapshots**\n\n\tBTRFS is great, providing some cool functionalities like snapshots and CoW. My goal was to use said snapshots with a simple yet effective app that had a GUI, like Timeshift. Timeshift requires a very specific layout of the btrfs subvolumes in order to work. An “@“ subvolume for the root partition and a “@home” subvolume for the Home user directory. \n\n\tI’ve seen many setups online, and people were using tons of sub-volumes when setting up their btrfs partitions. Some of them made sense, some were just there for the sake of being there. I decided that for my particular use-case, a root subvolume (“@“) and a home subvolume (“@home”) were enough (which is exactly what Timeshift requires).\n\n**Dual Boot with Windows with Bitlocker enabled and TPM2 auto-unlock for both OS-es**\n\n\tA controversial topic in the world of Archlinux was the success rate of dual-booting Archlinux and Windows, both using Secure Boot, TPM2 auto-unlock and Encryption enabled. I haven’t found many specific examples of this setup working successfully, so it was mostly trial and error on my side. I was determined to do it though, documenting myself with the specifics of UEFI, Secure Boot and TPM2. \n\n\tThe conclusion I reached is that Windows and Archlinux can flawlessly work in a dual-boot setup, both having Secure Boot and TPM2 auto-unlock enabled. The trick is to boot them directly from the UEFI Boot menu (this will allow the PCR7 Secure Boot bank to remain unchanged). If you try to boot Windows from the systemd boot menu (which will detect it as an entry), the PCR7 Secure Boot bank value will change and Bitlocker will prompt for the recovery key. Windows generally uses banks 7 and 11. For my Archlinux setup I’ve used banks 0 and 7.  \n\tEDIT: It is not the PCR 7 bank that changes and doesn't allow Windows to boot through systemd-boot, it is PCR 11, although PCR 7 also has a certain impact. As u/6e1a08c8047143c6869 pointed out: \"I think you mean PCR 11? The secure boot state (i.e. secure boot settings, keys, etc.) will not be changed by booting Windows through systemd-boot, but PCR 11 will\" and \"The issue here seems not to be that PCR 7 changes if you use sd-boot, but that Windows looks at all efi executables in the boot chain and refuses to bind the bitlocker key to PCR7 if any of them were signed by something other than themselves.\"\n\n\tOf course other banks can be used as well, for both OS-es, but the setup becomes gradually more complicated and prone to auto-unlock failure. This depends on one’s threat model.\n\n**Recovery UKI and BTRFS Snapshot UKI using the LTS Kernel**\n\n\tI always thought Safe Mode from Windows was pretty cool for debugging and troubleshooting, yet I did not know how to access something similar on linux. \n\n\tI eventually found out about systemd emergency target, so I created an UKI with mkinitcpio that had the a cmdline file addition that uses the following attribute: “systemd.unit=emergency.target”. This is used to boot the system into an “emergency / minimal” mode using systemd. From here on you can do various things since you have a shell available at your disposal. \n\n\tAnother UKI I made, was one that took advantage of the BTRFS snapshots feature. This one uses the following cmdline addition: “rootflags=subvol=/timeshift-btrfs/snapshots/YYYY-MM-DD\\\\\\_HH\\\\\\_MM\\\\\\_SS/@“ in order to create a UKI that boots a read/write snapshot directly. You can even use Timeshift from within the snapshot to restore the system to a previous point. It was pretty cool and fun when I actually got to see it boot!\n\n\tI decided that both of these \"recovery\" UKIs should use the LTS kernel, as a safety measure. The standard boot entries use the stable Linux kernel.\n\nI basically had 3 cmdline files in my /etc/kernel folder and 2 mkinitcpio presets (linux and linux-lts)\n\n1. The default one “cmdline” using the stable kernel.\n2. The emergency one “cmdline\\_recovery” using the LTS kernel.\n3. The snapshot one “cmdline\\_snapshot” using the LTS kernel as well.\n\nMy boot menu looks like this: [Bootmenu](https://imgur.com/a/rJVx1Nc)\n\nEDIT: When creating this setup I also wrote a full and fairly detailed guide/tutorial on it, just in case I needed to replicate the setup in the future and knowing that there is no way I'd just remember everything in it.\n\nSome people asked for the guide, so here it is: [Guide](https://drive.proton.me/urls/GKX84G630W#X49lqq0aYNYc) (I uploaded it on Proton Drive).\n\nEDIT2: As u/AppointmentNearby161 pointed out, only binding to PCRs measured pre-boot (PCRs 0-7) opens a vulnerability from rogue operating systems. A rogue partition with metadata copied from the real root filesystem (such as partition UUID) can mimic the original partition. More can be read about this on the [Archlinux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-cryptenroll#Trusted_Platform_Module). I also modified the guide to reflect this and to suggest a few potential fixes (be aware that I didn't had the time to test these fixes yet, so implement them with caution).",

Hell, I still consider myself a noob at this  \n  \nFor the oldschoolers; don't gatekeep. I agree that you'll learn a lot by reading the wiki, but it can be overwhelming for a lot of noobs. Let people use their system the way they want to use it- just because they don't do it YOUR way doesn't mean it's the WRONG way. \n\n  \nPlease flame me in the comments :D",

Restarting processes and apps to manage else everything slowed to a crawl and processes terminated.\n\nI have a heavy workload: 8 Docker containers, Local Substrate blockchain, Android Emulator, 1-2 NodeJS processes, 3-5 instances of Jetbrains IDE's (WebStorm, RustRover, Android Studio) and ofcourse too many browser tabs.\n\nI figured this was normal and increased swap to 32Gb. Was enough. \n\nThen I tried ZRAM and suddenly I'm hardly using my disk swap at all. At 1st I limited it a bit fearing running out of \"pure\" physical ram but the compression is 1:4 so increased to 2x my ram. Still only uses about 8Gb of it. Disk swap hardly used at all (about 5gb)\n\nThe best part though is the performance. No longer waiting for IDE's and browser tabs to swap back has made a huge difference. Jetbrains IDE's which are notorious memory hogs are now smooth.\n\nSo impressed I'm going to dig into the source as soon as I have time...",

I used to run Ubuntu WSL because I was initially a little curious about Linux and I wanted to do some low-level systems programming, which was really complicated with Windows.\n\nFurthermore, my laptop heats up very quickly when I just boot up Windows (task manager giving me ridiculous usage percentages), and I think on 5 different occasions, my screen just melted and glitched so I'd have to restart it or wait some time before I can use it.\n\nHowever, after gradually migrating most of my things to Arch Linux in May 2025, I can say that this is probably the greatest decision I ever made. Before Arch, I never imagined this would be possible:\n\n- Updating everything in my system with just a simple \"yay -Syu\"\n- Have a simple quick package manager that gets me all my essentials\n- Almost no stress on my CPU, GPU and RAM on boot\n- Everything I'll ever need is in less than 100 GB\n- No registry editor hell\n- No \"app is not on my laptop but it's still in my program list\" bs\n- Really high performance\n- I'm more aware about whats really happening to my laptop under the hood\n- Laptop doesn't heat up and send my fan to the damn ER\n- Custom keybinds that make me less reliant on my mouse\n\n...and the list just goes on, man.\n\nToday marks 6 months of me using Arch Linux (+ Hyprland), and I am very, very happy that I moved out of Windows. To be honest I only still kept Windows as a fallback, or when I can't use something on Arch, but 99% of my usage is on Arch.\n\nI really want to thank a lot of YouTube channels and the Arch and the overall Linux community for making this happen for me man, this is just awesome.",

Never mind, just remove the pkg symlink and make an empty directory instead.\n\nSo pacman is installed and it's time to arch-chroot and finish the system upgrade now. One small problem - I forgot to mount the boot partition, which resulted in the kernel going to wrong place and an unbootable system. Another small problem, I don't remember how I've setup the system boot. The system boots directly (only Arch on it), but I don't remember if I used a boot manager and which one was it.\n\nOK, time to install a boot manager. Just a simple one. Maybe I was using [rEFInd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/REFInd). I installed it and voila - a bootable system again. So breakage fixed. In fact two breakages - one caused by pacman and a second one caused by me. Now I can say Arch broke on me, btw!

So my dumbass thought let's format that partition from Windows Disk Management and I will install Arch on that partition and that was a huge mistake. \n\nAs I rebooted after formatting, I saw the grub command line which scared me a bit(seeing for the first time) but after searching online on how to boot from .efi file I booted into Windows, removed grub(after some online research) flashed Arch on a USB, booted into the USB and lo and behold I can install Arch now.\nI thought I could go the easy way with arch install but that didn't support dual boot ig or I couldn't figure out how to setup dual boot from arch install.\n\nActually Arch wiki is the best way to install Arch after 2 hours installing it for the 3rd time(1st install had mounted drives setup incorrectly and in the 2nd I messed up the Grub setup) it finally worked, booted from Grub Menu at Reboot everything worked fine, but wait a minute there is no Windows boot option in the Grub Menu because for some reason os-prober wasn't finding the Windows efi file, had to make a manual entry for Windows in the Grub Menu(prior research on where Windows efi file existed actually helped) and viola it's 3am(started at 11 pm if I remember correctly) and both Windows and Arch are booting properly.\n\n\n\nBonus: In the morning when I again boot Arch to install that quickshell and hyprland theme, iwctl didn't work(which it did in the setup) because it doesn't exist so again I boot the USB, mounted the drives correctly(I am good at it now) downloaded nmcli from inside there, removed the USB and now I could connect to the WiFi finally. Rest is history as it was smooth sailing from there onwards I still haven't had any issues from Arch except from caelestia-dots and quickshell which were fairly easy and minute fixes not really related to arch.\n\nThose 3-4 hours I spent installing actually helped me learn a lot more about how these software and hardware behave and is a journey I will probably remember for a long time.\n\n\n\nPS.

I used Ubuntu before, but switched because I don't believe in Canonicals' bad practices. If you are one of the Arch users who takes time to help newbies thank you! If you're a newbie yourself, don't worry about hostile users. People like me are happy to help! This is an amazing, dedicated community, which has made many extremely awesome accomplishments and I look forward to seeing all of us do cool things on us and the community growing! :)",

Many of the free written responses expressed a great deal of gratitude to you, and that gratitude is well deserved! Without you, this community simply wouldn't be, so thank you!\n* [Brodie Robertson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSyUvkpHv6M&amp;t=37s)! Thank you for showcasing our survey on your channel! It was unexpected, but thanks to your help, our survey had a significant increase in reach, and we appreciate it very much!\n* All **3,923** who participated! Without you, the snapshot of data we were able to capture wouldn't be what it is. So thank you for your time and contribution!\n* All who provided feedback! you've given us many tools and perspectives for use in the future, and have proven the value of community wisdom, so thank you very much!\n\n**Acknowledgement of Flaws**\n\n* Sample size: While we did see a significant sample, there may be variance when compared to the whole Arch user base.\n* Cultural / Lingual / Selection biases: This survey was only provided in English, to an Arch subreddit largely conducted in English\n* Self reported: We're taking everyone at their word\n* And others... Just know that we aren't claiming perfection here.\n\nBut overall, we think it was taken appropriately, and that the results are accurate and insightful\n\n**Explanation of Method**\n\nIt's important to know that not everyone saw the same set of questions. Those who expressed that they had not yet tried Arch were given a separate section, so as to ask them a more appropriate set of questions. This group was also asked many analogous questions to the main group, so that some comparisons could be drawn.\n\n**Highlights of Results**\n\nHere, I'll direct your attention to a few of the results I found interesting, but in the interest of both digestibility and letting the community draw its own conclusions, I'll keep this on the brief side\n\n* The posts we see don't represent the lingual diversity that's actually present on the subreddit\n   * Only **45.1%** of respondents claim English as their primary language.\n   * And **12.6%** or respondents reported an English proficiency that I would expect encounters communication difficulties at least some of the time.\n* We seem to have a wide, and fairly even distribution of experience. There are more users with relatively short terms of usership, but it does look like people tend to stay with Arch\n* Those who haven not yet tried Arch generally wish to use Arch in the future (**57%**)\n* The most cited reasons for not yet trying Arch are (in descending order)\n   * Setting up Arch involves too much configuration\n   * Stability issues, or concerns about stability issues\n   * The install process itself\n   * Happier with another distribution\n* Gaming compatibility is still a concern for **11.2%** of those who haven't tried Arch yet\n   * On the other hand, **77.6%** of Arch users report gaming as one of the activities they use Arch to do\n* KDE Plasma is by far the favorite graphical environment for both those who use Arch, and those who haven't yet (**36.8%** and **43%** respectively)\n   * Hyprland and Gnome are the silver and bronze medalists\n      * Among Arch users Hyprland has **26.4%** and Gnome has **10.8%**\n      * Among Arch Excluded, Gnome has **21.5%** and Hyprland has **13.2%**\n   * Arch users also have a noticeable affinity for Sway (**4.6%**), i3 (**4.4%**), and xfce (**3.4%**)\n   * COSMIC may be new, but it's already attracted a lot of attention\n      * **17.7%** of respondents report having given it a try\n      * **1.3%** of respondents declared COSMIC as their favorite\n* Kitty and Konsole were neck and neck for the favorite terminal emulator as the results were coming in, but the ultimate favorite was Kitty (**30%**). Konsole finished with **23.5%**, and Alacritty finished with **17.4%**\n   * I didn't expect Foot to be as popular as it was, and I apologize for not including it in the initial prompt. Foot has the hearts of **4.74%** of respondents, making it overall, the 5th most popular.\n\n**Hardware Breakdown**\n\nCPU\n\n|\\-|Intel|AMD|Other|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Arch Users (3798)|41.8%|57.7%|0.34%|\n|Arch Excl (123)|41.5%|55.3%|3.25%|\n\n* Others mentioned include Apple Silicon, ARM, \"I don't Know\", and responses reporting that they have multiple main systems with differing configurations.\n\nGPU\n\n|\\-|Nvidia|AMD-D|AMD-I|Intel-D|Intel-I|Other|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Arch Users (3794)|40%|31.7%|10.1%|1%|15.3%|1.98%|\n|Arch Excl (123)|42.3%|28.5%|8.1%|0|15.4%|5.69%|\n\n* For brevity, \"D\" indicates \"dedicated\", and \"I\" indicates \"integrated\"\n* Others mentioned include \"I don't know\", Apple Silicon, ARM, Hybrid configurations, and responses reporting that they have multiple main systems with differing configurations\n\nRoot Hard Drive\n\n|\\-|M.2 / NVMe|Sata SSD|Sata HDD|External HD|Other|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Arch Users (3768)|77%|17.9%|3.4%|0.5%|1.17%|\n|Arch Excl (0)|n/a|n/a|n/a|n/a|n/a|\n\n* Others mentioned include: Virtual, eMMC, Flash Drive / SD, Floppy Drive, Fusion Drive, and IDE HDD\n\n**Highlights from long form responses**\n\n* There were many long form responses thanking those who develop or contribute to Arch. There were even some saying that I should have mentioned something about donations in the survey\n   * I probably won't include this in a future survey *directly*, but if you're grateful for Arch , and wish to express some of that gratitude, the following link is where you can do so. If you can't, no worries, but if you can, even a small donation is very helpful\n   * Donate: [https://archlinux.org/donate/](https://archlinux.org/donate/)\n* By far, the most common long form response was \"*I use Arch, btw*\"\n   * I too use Arch ... ... ... btw\n* Another common response was those which expressed gratitude for the Wiki\n   * A little looking, a little reading, and a little patience does go a long way!\n* *my answer to \"my preferred way of completing a task\" question, is more like \"depends on how easy or annoying it is on cli/gui\"*\n   * I do apologize for the vague nature of this question. This response was included as an elaboration to that question, and I believe it represents well what the poll results were trying to convey. I'll try to give that question some better direction next time.\n* Some users expressed a want for Arch to support ARM, or for Arch Linux ARM to pick up support\n   * Given the recent direction consumer hardware has started moving, I agree, this would be nice to see\n* Many users wish to tell their past selves to \"*Take your backups!*\"\n   * They walked so we can run!\n\nAnd many, many more... I'll be reading through all these responses for quite a while. (Access to the complete set of long form responses seems to be limited due to volume. This was not set by us, and I will do what I can to make them all available, but I don't yet have an answer)\n\nThere's a lot more to be discovered in the full results. So if you have time, I encourage giving them a look! Please feel free to share your discoveries in the comments.\n\nWith that, this is the conclusion of this survey! I have so much gratitude for all who participated and contributed, so thank you to everyone. I look forward to seeing you all for the next one!\n\nEdit: Appending the [Survey Opening Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1hf7yda/arch_linux_community_survey/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

It was just for fun, 2 years ago i can't imagination how i change my OS from windows to some distributive at linux. 2 weaks ago i go buy new ssd disk for arch, because i want leave my OS at windows at second disk, I need some programs which exists only at windows. Before downloading arch I'm tried use WSL, but it was not good, i dont enjoy it. But moment, when i bought new disk and download my first distro in my life and how i know arch mark as hard distro for new, this was perfect. My first login in system was a good, but one moment. My second monitor have problems, my GHZ was 60 and when I changed, that was 60 GHZ. I had the opportunity to change my GHZ and I click save, but any changes. So, my friends say: \"You have a problems with drivers, fix this\". I go to fix. Maybe I spent one day for fix and right now my second monitor work good, without any problem. When I'm fix, maybe I removed some driver and my second monitor did't work. After i start work with Vs code and i had also some problems, because more extantions don't find if I download vs code from official website, but i can find more extanstions if I download from software store, but I can't use yarn or something else. I find solution just download with yay. It's helped me. \n\nI'm moved to arch beacuse windows have many useless updates, which eat my GB at ssd disk. And system was slow for coding, because many trash was downloaded at my pc, from me and from windows. I'm never like tab with news or more trash from windows. I'm every time clean my disk, because updates have a big size (my ssd 220+gb) and every update take many GB of my memory. With arch i don't have any problems with sizes, I downloaded at my system only things, which i need. I don't see any news every launch, i don't see any updates and crashes. Windows have a good sides also, but arch I liked more then windows. Perhaps not much time for my review, but I think its okay. I use this system just for coding, but this coding became a comfortable at 100%\n\nMaybe someone want also share own road to linux or experience",

I learned to use cgdisk instead of fdisk due to my mistakes in #2 although in earlier parts of the attempts I used windows' own partition software to divide everything.  \n2.) accidentally wiped out my windows(this happened like 3 times, yeah...I should have just used lsblk instead of trying to memorize everything) I  \n3.) did not create the boot/efi folder, I thought it was just \"mount --mkdirr /dev/sda2/ \" and that was it  \n4.) did not create genfstab  \n5.) forgot my password on the login  \n6.) did not install dhcpcd, which led to networkmanager and iwd tweaking and disconnecting everything and not connecting even with proper SSID.  \n7.) I did not understand that I have to put \"root\" on the login, so I was just stumped there and kept reinstalling until I used my head and used google.  \n8.) did not understand that I have to use **sudo nano /etc/locale.conf** and the other instructions that told me to edit something in etc/ folder. I was just there stumped asking why the \"command\" /**etc/locale.conf** is not working  \n9.) did not install bootloader  \n10.) did not install efibootmgr  \n11.) did not install networkmanager or iwd  \n12.) did not search how to cancel a ping so I was stuck there for 30 mins just waiting for ping to end learned that I can just control c by just experimenting.  \n13.) put my country in the part where you /usr/region/city /localtime of something. I was supposed to put the continent.  \n14.) put root as my root password because I read it on a comment(I maybe slow)  \n15.) last one forgot to install nano\n\nI'm probably forgetting some more mistakes but here are the stuff that got me. Right now I'm thinking of trying to install gentoo on virtualbox on windows or try to learn virtualization in arch if I have time.",

Fedora was just overall very buggy in my opinion.\n\nUp to this point I’ve stayed away from arch hearing that it’s impossible to install and use, ran arch install and it was as straight forward as any other distro, set up time shift with btrfs snapshots and installed an LTS kernel (because I’ve heard of arch breaks this will come in handy), as easy as you’d want. No issues, at this point I’m bewildered as I’ve set up a minimal system with literally nothing going wrong, (was also easy af using the arch manual) but then came the games, installed goverlay Mangohud and gamemode, no problem, played a brand new released game (Like a dragon pirate yakuza in Hawaii) fedora had weird audio issues with this game among other issues but on arch, nothing, perfect. \n\nArch was my last ditch effort at Linux after trying 10+ distros and so far it’s been absolutely flawless, the only thing I fear now is an update causing my system to break, but falling back to an LTS kernel or using timeshift should be the solution.\n\nSince I do not tinker around with my Linux systems I hope my arch installation will keep working for the foreseeable future, I’ll barely be using the AUR, all I do is web browsing and gaming and with fedoras freezing and audio issues even that was a pain.

Some were fixed with a local rebuild and reinstall by the user, using the new version of `icu` on their system. `-bin` packages needed to be rebuilt by the AUR maintainer and released with a new version.\n\nAlso, take special care to [not have partial upgrades](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/System_maintenance#Partial_upgrades_are_unsupported), as this caused official repo packages to break in the previous icu update too (including `pacman` itself, and unbootable systems). Just do a `pacman -Syu` to prevent or fix that.\n\nFor a temporary solution to get the problematic AUR packages working:\n\n[icu75](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/icu75) from AUR can be installed, if you have already updated to `icu-76` via pacman. This will let you have the old version alongside the new version, so that those AUR applications still have access to the older libraries. When the problematic packages' AUR maintainers update them, you would no longer need the `icu75` package. (I have not tested the new `icu75` package myself, but this was the nicest solution for the previous icu update issues.)\n\ne.g. [ungoogled-chromium-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ungoogled-chromium-bin) seems to be broken now, with a new version currently being compiled by the maintainer.",

OR if it fails to run mkinitcpio during your update, be sure to fix the config and re-run it or you wont be able to boot. \n\nHere is the forum thread in question:\n\nhttps://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=304822\n\nEDIT 2:\nThis deprecation possibly should have had a corrisponding news item on the Arch homepage to save us from sky is falling claims of broken kernel builds.

    "body": "Hi.. like most people I used windows my entire life. I liked windows because it was easy and you could basically do anything, i install whatever you want. My first OS was windows xp, then 7, then windows 8(hated that by the way), used windows 10 and 11.... I have used linux distros too in between like ubuntu and kali Linux in my school days. Didn't really liked ubuntu. I liked kali but went back to windows because games and other things weren't supported properly on Linux. I just found windows better overall. Now, after windows dropped their windows 11 i noticed my laptop got slower and it felt like windows was just trying to monetize everything by showing me ads and useless info. Taskbar was filled with bunch of crap i never used. I saw PewDiePie video of him switching to Linux and thought maybe i should try it too for real and not just dual boot it and then come back to windows and i installed arch on my laptop and used hyprland. It was Fun trying to figure it out. It was kind of silly using terminal to change my brightness, breaking it and reinstalling it again🤣 soon after some time i got some hand of it. Experimented a little with dotfiles then found a project on GitHub called Hyde desktop environment, tried it, liked it, and then just used that till now. It's been more than 5 months now and recently i tried using windows on my friend's laptop and mannnn....it just felt soo slow...like...using mouse to move my cursor and then clicking on apps to open them...yuckkkkkk 🤣🤣 sounds kinda funny but i didn't expect that using arch for some months would make me hate windows soo much...i couldn't believe I used to use that shit for soo long... In uni while all struggle to set up virtual environments for their python project i do it in seconds in my terminal. Everything still doesn't work perfectly out of box on Linux but still the fact that you can just fix it is soo amazing.. and now with all the tools like chatgpt, if you have any problem just copy all the errors from terminal and it'll guide you step by step how to fix it. Using arch has completely changed my perspective on how you should use a computer and how OS should be meant to serve you....now I can't even imagine going back to windows or use any other os like mac os",

I don't have a good answer to that. To me, Arch is not about learning Arch. Its about enabling learning other things. Some of those things are easy. Some are hard.

I installed Gentoo several times, enchanted by the romance of compiling packages from source (and each time, that romance was shattered after the tedious wait for compilation to finish, only to gain negligible performance improvements) and the constant issues with broken dependencies.\n\nI also tried NixOS. I really liked the idea of a declarative system setup, where everything could be configured via a config file and modules… But the lack of normal FHS, and the fact that all issues had to be solved strictly the Nix way… Also NixOS has a terrible documentation, NixOS documentation made me appreciate ArchWiki even more than before! Oh, and the huge problems it caused for me as a programmer due to the system’s peculiarities… All of that just wasn’t worth the effort. None of it was worth it, even though I loved the idea of a declarative distro.. Maybe it's just a skill issue from my side, but.. nggaaaah!\n\nAt the same time, I always came back to Arch because, for me now, it’s like home. I know everything I need to know about it, it’s minimalist, and it doesn’t demand any super-deep knowledge or excessive time investment to get what I want. After every new distro I tried - I always returned to Arch and was glad that everything was just the way it should be. No need for killer features from exotic distros - those usually end up being the reason why users leave them. Though, of course, to each their own. If you like that - go for it, but I’d still prefer Arch.",

I did several arch linux installation, and if I need to choose a PC OS, I'll use arch.\n - I don't want to use Debian server, because it feels a bit old. It seems that debian is very stable, but that it isn't very well updated. I dunno if this is much of an issue, so please tell me.\n - I don't want to use Ubuntu Server, because I don't really like how Ubuntu is. For me, it's really bloated, and I don't like having a bloated server. Maybe it's just me, so again, please tell me your opinion.\n\nCons:\n - Rolling updates: A lot of people doesn't like Arch because each day, there are new updates and you NEED to check your server each day, and make a lot of maintenance for it. I dunno if this is much of a problem, so again, please tell me.\n\nSome people proposed me Void Linux, but again, please tell me your opinion\n\n(EDIT AFTER 30 DAYS)\nOkay so RemindMe bot just reminded me this message.\n\nSo, after 30 days (I guess), I got my server, and it was really good !!!\nI saw on htop less process than Ubuntu Server, but I don't really know if this is better, and if I just didn't make a placebo effect.\nPerformance side, the minecraft server didn't changed much.\nUsability side: I didn't have much of updates to make, once a week it worked well. Because I like arch, it was easier to me to use arch than ubuntu server, but if you like ubuntu server/debian, go for it.\n\nSo, the conclusion: Using arch as a server wasn't much of a difference; You don't really need to check every day for an update, but there isn't a really big performance gap between both.\nUse Arch for server if you know how to use it, and if you're comfortable with arch. Use Ubuntu Server / Debian if you're comfortable with Debian based Linux distros.",

Why not? I just finished my exams and i have little better to do before I start my summer job.\n\nIt was just a straight forward install...\n\nSure, you had to mess with some config files and partition some drives. But most of this stuff is things that most people have done before. I anyways needed to mess with the Fstab to mount my Sambashares and make users with different perms so my partner can use my computers without accidentally messing with my system. (or atleast lowering the risk). This stuff that I usually do after the installation, I just got the opportunity to do during the installation. Different, but not more difficult.\n\nThe real thing that I found a bit difficult was getting the boot loader to work. So yah, that did take an hour or so, I must admit. But I would not consider it too painful with the Arch-Wiki literally holding my hand through the entire process.\n\nI do say that I am enjoying Arch so far. I have felt like I needed to wrestle some of the pre-installed software in openSUSE to get my system working like I wanted it too. Which is something I am yet to feel in Arch. But other than that its just a normal working distribution. I have been scammed into thinking it was this super complicated integrates system of machinery lol.\n\nI guess what I am trying to express is that Arch is more mundane than what a lot of people hype it up to be.

    "body": "One day I was messing around with interesting new things I could tinker within my setup and I decided I wanted added security for no particular reason. Thus, after looking for what security things I could do, I went down the Secure Boot on Linux rabbit hole.\n\nAfter a few hours of messing around with shim and getting it working with the default keys, I realised I was still weak and not asserting full dominance over the machine, for this way I was using Microsoft's Secure Boot keys, which made things easier, but, Microsoft, you know? I use Arch btw, I do things my way, I don't want no Microsoft here.\n\nWith newfound energy, I went down the custom Secure Boot keys hole. I updated my BIOS to the latest stable version to have all the fancy features and fixes, and off I went!\n\nThis one far more interesting, for it involved figuring the keys out, which was a lot of fun, generating them, setting up auto-signing of the kernels as pacman hooks... Lots of fun stuff to spend a day doing.\n\nBut the final stretch was truly the most fun - messing with the firmware to get it added as an allowed key in the first place! The part that involves jank because your mobo's manufacturer added the feature in for UEFI compliance and probably never tested it!\n\nAfter ~~slowly losing my mind~~ bashing the keyboard in this one specific way, I figured out the idiosyncrasies Gigabyte wanted me to do to get a custom key enrolled and allowed to boot.\n\nSuccess! I did it! I achieved Security Enlightenment! No more pesky malicious files could ever be booted to possibly log my disk encryption password! All the security! I reboot to behold in admiration all the invisible processes happening to secure all, in my naturally optimised setup with 1 whole whopping second shaved off the regular boot time.\n\nI tremble in anticipation of all the power I am about to assert before this machine, all the security!\n\n---\n\nNo POST. Hmm, that's odd, I only set up Secure Boot with a custom key, no other settings were changed. I reboot again. No POST, nothing. I stare contest the motherboard's pretty lights. Bootlooped after a few seconds, huh. That's most peculiar!\n\nI start disconnecting hardware. Re-plugging cables, checking the power supply. All looking mighty fine. I take out the CMOS battery to reset everything. Nothing. No POST. Only pretty lights for me to stare at. I briefly consider hanging it on the wall as a decoration.\n\nThis is *most* peculiar.\n\n---\n\nI went to RMA the motherboard, thankfully still under warranty, and, surprisingly, it *didn't* magically start working when demonstrating it to the tech! Now that would have been awkward!\n\nA few weeks later I got a new motherboard, unclear whether it was a full replacement or a repair, however. I can henceforth conclude that Gigabyte agreed with me on this being most peculiar and very un-supposed to happen, for otherwise I would have been charged for the fix.\n\nAnd this is how the power of customisability and doing it all my own way has shown me I am powerful enough to brick an entire motherboard by just enrolling an approved key for Secure Boot.\n\n---\n\nI never shared this with anyone in writing, ahah, maybe this silly way of sharing it gets a few laughs out of you.",

    "body": "Trying out Linux on Ubuntu was also a great decision because it lead me into the world of Linux.  \nGetting into Linux puts you down a path of gaining more and more understanding and control over your machines.  \nI first attempted to install arch 5-6 years ago.  \nAt that point I had experience in webdev and running python and Arduino C++ on micro-controllers.  \n\nAt that point I switched from Ubuntu to Archlinux on a whim, just because I wanted try out something new.   \nI fumbled my way through the install following along the guide on the archwiki.  \nAfter I had got all my partitions correct, chrooted, setup grub, and my user and passwd to login, I tried booting it up from disk.    \n\nI was confused why there was only a black terminal with simple text for me to input my username.  \nI was even more confused why there was nothing to click on once I logged in.  Just a blinking cursor in the terminal.  \n\nAfter some googling, I realized I had to install a desktop environment (I chose XFCE).  \nThen I went through choosing which other programs I wanted to install with pacman until I figured out that some packages aren't there and you had to use the Arch User Repository and go through this whole make build process.  \nThen I discovered there was an AUR package to make installing AUR packages easier called `yay` (although I use paru now).  \nI got everything eventually setup into a usable state within few days to a week or so and decided I wanted to try in on my work machine.  \n\nTwo months later I horribly mis-configured something so that my computer was never able to shutdown and always saw some sort of `watchdog` message on repeat.  \n\nFast-forward to now, I am comfortable setting up a new machine with archlinux from scratch and have my dotfiles stored in a repo.  \nI don't need clicky DEs anymore and use `i3` (it's dope).  \nI don't rice too hard, just `picom` and a nice randomized background with `feh`.  \nI escaped VSCode and now neovim as my editor.  \nI also love/depend on `tmux` and miss it most whenever I am back on a Windows machine.  \nI never bothered with a display manager and just enter `startx` to launch i3.  \nIf I fail my password too many times in a sudo command (which happens embarrassingly often) I developed a habit of switching TTYs, logging in as root user and using `faillock` to let me try again.  \n\nAt this point I am still nowhere close to being an expert of archlinux or most things Linux related.  \nBut getting into archlinux helped me learn and grow so much more as a programmer than if I had stayed complacent with Windows and Ubuntu.  \nIt helped me discover my tastes and realize that was even an option on an operating system.  \nIt can look and feel the way I want it to.  \n\nAll that being said, I am feeling pretty cozy and complacent here now though and doubt I will switch to a different OS anytime soon :)",

It made sense, I built the computers so I should do the same with the OS.\n\nThe challenge I set to myself was I was only allowed to use the wiki and reddit but not directly ask anyone anything. I found so many answers here and now I have a fully functioning system set up exactly how I want it. Security is how I want it, I have pretty much all of my steam library working with no issues thanks to protondb. \n\nBasically you've made me fall in love with computing again. I even loved spending 6 hours trying to get my system to auto mount my other drives on boot and allow steam to use them.

Open source software is truly incredible. The biggest revaltion for me as a windows user since windows 95 was that software can be safe.

It was just the same garbage sites offering these trials and you pay through your teeth. Then I found handBrake it is perfect and feature rich.\n\nJust wish I'd done it sooner.

GNOME has been rock solid for me, and I have discovered it is far more customizable than I gave it credit for\n* **Custom** **4K GRUB themes** → not only functional but also really slick to look at\n\nThe result?

Plus, it eats up system resources like crazy.\n\nIs there any better way to use the full Microsoft Office suite on Arch without relying on the web versions or Wine?\n\nWould appreciate any suggestions from people in a similar boat!\n\nThanks Advanced….",

    "body": "After months of trying a bit of Fedora in Virtualbox, I decided to make the switch.\n\n\nI'm not entirely new to Linux, I have experience in using the cli because I needed to ssh to a work server to retrieve or upload files.\n\n\nThe reason why I wanted to move to Linux was because I couldn't stand how Windows throws ads at me everywhere, along with how much of a ram hog it has gotten (Have you seen how much of ram Windows can use on idle?). It also has the issue of forced updates, along with how the OS just \"doesn't work when I want it to\". \n\n\nWell of course it was hard to make the switch still until I saw Pewdiepie's video. Here I thought, \"If a non-tech YouTuber can customise all of that, I can do it too\"\n\n\nSo I decided to backup my important files to another drive, and funnily enough I feel like Windows could sense it's death is coming as explorer.exe when I tried to open the file browser. Worse of all, when I tried to restart it, guess what? Task Manager of all things crashed too. After an hour of trying to wrestle with this system, along with repairing the Windows Installation (Which was corrupted when I checked, and don't worry my disks and ram are fine when I did checks). I backed up my files and decided to move to Linux. \n\n\nNow at this point I was terrified, I've never fully left Windows before, but I thought the first leap is always the hardest. If things break, let it break, I have backups so whatever. \n\n\nThe first distro I went to was Fedora, I got it running but... Oh dear, Nvidia doesn't play nice. I got it up and running but nope, something else breaks. \n\n\nI decided to try another distro, OpenSUSE Tumbleweed. Installed it, it works... Nvidia again. I never managed to get Nvidia working there, and I got the issue where shutting down would lead to seeing blank terminal screen with just an underscore there. \n\n\nI tried to find solutions, but I didn't really have luck. I noticed one pattern however whenever I searched for solutions online. I always see Arch Wiki in the search results of Google. \n\n\"Arch Linux? Isn't that the distro with the hardest installation procedure?\"\n\n\nThe biggest factor that made me want to try is the community and the Arch Linux Wiki.\n\n\nI took the plunge, spent an entire weekend morning trying to install it. The full terminal experience was scary but the Arch Wiki is amazing on guiding through the whole installation.\n\n\nWhen it was finally over, I got everything up and running, Nvidia worked, all my sound drivers and WiFi worked too. \n\n\nI would like to say I appreciate the Arch Wiki, because they have the best documentation of pretty much almost anything on installing Arch Linux and getting it running. I am happy with my new system, I got a taste of freedom. No more ads, no more forced updates. System works when I tell it to work.\n\n\nIs it a beginner distro in my opinion? No. \nIs it good at learning Linux? It's excellent. \nInstalling Arch Linux is pretty much a \"I get it now\" meme moment for me. \n\n\nTo anyone considering to jump to Linux: Back up your files and take the plunge. The first step is the hardest I know but it's worth it. \n\n\nTo anyone considering to try Arch Linux: The hardest part is reading and following instructions, I cannot stress this enough. It's not the cli commands, it's reading that's hard. The world has made it such that our attention spans are pretty much like a goldfish now, and I swear it's somehow making us dumber each day, like there's an agenda to make us dumber on purpose.\n\n\nThank you to the Arch community, you guys are awesome. \n\n\nI can finally say: I use Arch btw\n\nEdit: Typo",

Whenever the RAM usage increases to around 5-7 GB, the system optimizes aggressively, reducing the usage back to 3-5 GB. During this process, the screen occasionally freezes for a few seconds. While I appreciate Arch's minimalism and efficiency, I have 16 GB of RAM and would prefer it to use the available memory rather than optimizing so aggressively that it causes noticeable lags.\n\nMy primary goal with Arch is to deepen my understanding of Linux internals and enjoy a tailored experience—not necessarily to hyper-optimize resource usage at the cost of smooth performance. I also dislike the stereotype that Arch or Linux users are only using old, underpowered machines. Many of us have modern hardware, and it’s important to ensure Linux distributions make full use of it.\n\nI’ve gone through the documentation, but most of the advice I’ve found focuses on reducing RAM and CPU usage—essentially the opposite of my problem.

Yes you're using Arch now, the wiki is great, Arch is great, Arch taught you everything and more etc. Or how about the same threads posted as questions?\nWhat is great about Arch, what did you learn from Arch, why don't you use another distro?....\n\nSo it's not productive to look into a guy's problem because it *might* be found somewhere else but it's perfectly fine to participate in \"what do you like about Arch, number 6,789,312?\n\nThis is like /r/programming where actual articles about coding are downvoted because \"not really something new\" while \"How google hires programmers #596933311\" or \"Never use XY because I didn't like it -my blog post #38383819191\" are top articles.\n\nYes I can just unsubscribe and nobody forces me to be here and it's not the purpose of this sub that I -some random guy- likes it.

    "body": "I just had the most ridiculous bug I have seen in my 15 years of Linux.  \n\nI was watching a movie in VLC, in fullscreen. It was a first time I've seen this movie. In one scene, the character turned off all lights, and screen went black. In the darkness, someone was talking, fighting, running for ten minutes. I was sitting there wondering at the creativity of the movie director, until I got bored and wanted to stop it. Then I found out that controls don't work. Including Alt-Tab and other system hotkeys. Ctrl-Alt-Esc saved the day. I started the movie again and found out that actually there is a video right after the black moment!\n\nSo, when VLC encounters a total black moment in video, it stops showing the picture forever (while playing sound) and somehow stops hotkeys from DE working. Only X server's hotkeys work. Further testing shows that it happens only on Arch (latest VLC version, I guess), only in KDE, only in fullscreen and only when VDPAU decoder is on and used. It also only happens with digitally made movies because only they can have totally black frames. Home video and analog tapes always have at least some noise. \n\nImagine the bewilderment I was in for the first time! Heh. \n\nP.S. VLC bugtracker refused me in registration, so I am not reporting it. It is a keeper!\n\nP.P.S. VDPAU, I mean VDPAU decoder. The Nvidia one. I always forget those names.",

Of course I hit them with \"I use Arch btw\", and when they asked me as to why I chose that distro, I said \"It's neat and minimalist while also being a bleeding edge distro\", and then they hit me with \"Well we're running Arch on our servers\" – these guys need the latest libraries and things like that, not gonna get into details. Needless to say, I got pretty excited about that prospect and didn't wait to express that.\n\nAfter a couple more questions I was told that they're gonna get back to me in somewhere around a week or so, we said our goodbyes and the interview was over. Then, some 5-10 minutes later I remembered about some aspect of the conditions or something like that, so I went ahead and asked the recruiter about that. Out of the blue, she hits me with: \"We decided that you're a suitable candidate for this position\" and all that. Having a soft skills interview on Monday, but that's more of a formality, pretty much like interviews with recruiters. Never had issues with neither former, nor latter.\n\nSo, what I'm getting at is it looks like what started as my little experiment to see if I'd like Linux more than Windows, turned into genuine passion and with a little bit of additional complementary skills learning – into a decent job, so there's one more reason to love Arch. To say that I feel on top of the world would be an understatement.",

    "body": "So, this is mostly just a thank you to all those selfless folks that put in time to maintain packages, update and maintain the wiki, and all the other things I'm not even smart enough to mention. \n\nIt's been about 10 years since I discovered Linux in general, and only about 3 since I've been familiarizing myself with Arch and the other distros out there. I've absolutely fallen in love with the idea of open source, community-driven knowledge and software. \n\nRecently, I've been dealing with a lot: I'm trying to finish my last 9 credit hours to graduate with my bachelors in CS, I'm married, I have a job lined up for when (... not if) I graduate, and I've been in custodial court for the last 6 years over my daughter. Last night I hit a bit of a wall, and found myself pretty down. Like, couldn't muster the energy to do ANYTHING, down. I'm sure some of you are familiar with that feeling. \n\nI decided I'd give a go of getting Arch installed on my new laptop, alongside Windows. I've done several Arch installs now without hitch, but getting UEFI working with Windows was something I hadn't attempted yet, and definitely made me a little nervous to try. I figured that, if nothing else, I'd be able to distract myself by working on that until I got tired and needed to go to bed. \n\nLo and behold, as is always the case, the Arch Wiki was my Bible. I had it all working successfully within about 2 hours of starting this little mini-quest. Believe it or not, all it took was this small victory to get me out of my slump. I woke up feeling optimistic and a little proud of myself for at the very least being able to RTFM, lol. \n\nSo, thanks again for all your nerds out there that make this kind of thing possible. Thank you for everyone who pours over the Wiki, correcting out-of-date pages and ensuring it maintains good readability. Thank you for helping me remember that there's always tomorrow, and that we can always find inspiration in the most unusual and unexpected ways.\n\nEdit: hey everybody, stop spending your money or whatever on awards! Just dropping a “&lt;3” in the comments can achieve the same effect. Regardless, thank you from the bottom of my heart for the love. It means a lot. If anyone ever needs a stranger to talk to about ANYTHING, be it work, Linux, girls (no promises on my ability to help there, though), depression, or how stupid the two-party political system is, please don’t hesitate to drop me a line.",

    "body": "I've performed a dark ritual experiment in an ***unsupported*** way of running Arch and collected real-world data throughout a one-year period. This is purely for research purposes and should not be blindly followed.\n\nTLDR: Arch has been rock solid and yielded 99.96% availability via unattended updates, and greatly exceeded my expectations.\n\nOne year ago, I created an instance at Oracle Cloud and decided to run Arch Linux on it. It's a minimalist installation of the `base` system, the `linux` kernel, the `grub` bootloader, and a bunch of packages such like VPN service. This instance is for the sole purpose of a VPN server. The total number of packages installed is around 145. I sticked to the default configuration as much as possible to minimise chances of generating `pacnew`.\n\nI was curious what would happen if I do unattended updates and reboot on a daily basis.\n\nContent of `/root/autoupdate.sh`:\n\n    date &gt;&gt; /root/autoupdate.log\n    pacman -Syu --noconfirm &gt;&gt; /root/autoupdate.log 2&gt;&amp;1\n    reboot\n\nContent of `crontab -e`:\n\n    15 20 * * * /root/autoupdate.sh\n\nList of systemd services enabled by me:\n\n    cronie\n    haveged\n    VPN service\n    sshd\n    paccache.timer\n    systemd-networkd\n    systemd-networkd-wait-online\n\nLast year the Arch installation guide still recommended `dhcpcd`. However, this later proved to be problematic for the VPN service to start correctly only after the network is up. I replaced it with `systemd-networkd`, and this has been the only major maintenance ever required throughout the whole year.\n\nI queried the log of the VPN service via `journalctl -u &lt;VPN service name&gt;`. Then I exported the timestamps of the stopping and starting of the VPN service, and worked out that the total downtime has been 2 hours, 53 minutes and 18 seconds throughout the last 327 days (omitted about a month due to log lost to a restoration from a snapshot). This is 99.96% availability.\n\nLuckily my VPS instance never got borked due to a new format of configuration required. List of `pacnew` files found via `cat /var/log/pacman.log | grep pacnew`:\n\n    /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.pacnew\n    /etc/locale.gen.pacnew\n    /etc/systemd/homed.conf.pacnew\n    /etc/default/grub.pacnew\n\nDisk usage has converged to 3.8 GiB while `paccache.timer` keeps the last 3 versions of each package.\n\nConclusion:\n\nWith minimalist installation and minimal customisation, it is possible to let Arch roll unattended without human intervention. Packages from the Core repo has proved to be of high quality. Hopefully this data provides some insight into building high-availability systems with failover relying on Arch unattended.",

You can choose yes if you don't want your package managers to automatically upgrade to the latest freetype2 package when updating your system. You can always remove it from ignore pkg list by editing your `/etc/pacman.conf` file.\n\nThe fix will land in the next Steam update and you should update freetype2 and steam then.

Kernel and Drivers\n\n* When picking what kernel to use (Latest or LTS) the latest will most likely have better performance and battery life especially on newer hardware, the LTS will have better stability and reliability.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nrun **sudo pacman -S linux-firmware** if you haven't installed it.\n\n[Arch Wiki page to the Linux kernel](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/kernel).\n\n[Arch Wiki page for NVIDIA drivers](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA#Installation).\n\n[Arch Wiki page for AMD drivers](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AMDGPU#Installation).\n\n[Arch Wiki page for Intel drivers](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/intel_graphics#Installation).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Step 2. Wayland\n\n* **Wayland is not required for this guide.**\n* [Wayland has better power saving than X.org](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=KDE-Plasma-Wayland-Power), for KDE run **sudo pacman -S plasma-wayland-session** (if you are an [NVIDIA](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA) user, also install [egl-wayland](https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=egl-wayland), and if the session does not start with the proprietary [nvidia](https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=nvidia) driver, also enable the [DRM kernel mode setting](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA#DRM_kernel_mode_setting)), then select the session from your login screen, on Gnome wayland should be enabled by default. For other desktop environments I'll leave the [Arch Wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/desktop_environment).\n\n[Arch Wiki page to Wayland](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Wayland).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Step 3. Early KMS\n\n* You'll need early KMS for *step 9.*\n* Early KMS can fix hibernation issues on Intel GPU's.\n* From Arch Wiki **\"KMS also enables newer technologies (such as DRI2) which will help reduce artifacts and increase 3D performance, even kernel space power-saving.\"**\n* I'm not sure how this works with dual GPU's systems with mixed brands please look into that before doing this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nrun **sudo nano /etc/mkinitcpio.conf**\n\n***MODULES=( ) &gt;&gt; MODULES=(i915)***  |  save and exit.\n\nrun **sudo mkinitcpio -P**\n\nrun **lsmod | grep** **intel\\_agp**  |  if the module is not loaded reboot and continue to step 4.

Hardware Acceleration\n\n* Arch Wiki **\"**[**Hardware video acceleration**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit#GPU_accelerated_video_decoding) **makes it possible for the video card to decode/encode video, thus offloading the CPU and saving power.\"**\n* For Dual GPU laptops enabling GPU switching will use you iGPU for light work and dGPU for heavy work, the power savings can be massive, I left Arch Wiki pages for GPU switching at the bottom on this post.\n* **The guide is for Intel GPU's I left Arch Wiki pages for other GPU brands below it should be similar to what is done here.**\n* After you've set everything up I recommend seeing this [Arch Wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hardware_video_acceleration#Configuring_applications) to enable hardware acceleration in applications.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nrun **lspci | grep VGA** to see your GPU\n\nFor [GPU's 2014 and newer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_graphics_processing_units) run **sudo pacman -S intel-media-driver**  |  From Arch Wiki **\"HD Graphics series starting from Broadwell (2014) and newer are supported by intel-media-driver.\"**\n\nFor [GPU's 2013 and older](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_graphics_processing_units) run **sudo pacman -S libva-intel-driver**  |  From Arch Wiki ***\"GMA*** **4500 (2008) and newer GPUs, including HD Graphics up to Coffee Lake (2017) are supported by libva-intel-driver.\"**\n\nAlso run **sudo pacman -S libvdpau-va-gl libva-utils vdpauinfo**\n\nrun **export** **LIBVA\\_DRIVER\\_NAME=iHD**  |  If you installed intel-media-driver\n\nrun **export** **LIBVA\\_DRIVER\\_NAME=i965**  |  If you install libva-intel-driver\n\nrun **export VDPAU\\_DRIVER=va\\_gl**\n\nrun **vainfo** to confirm everything is working.\n\nrun **vdpauinfo** to confirm everything is working.\n\nIf everything is working run **sudo nano /etc/environment** and add **LIBVA\\_DRIVER\\_NAME=iHD** or **LIBVA\\_DRIVER\\_NAME=i965** (Depending on which driver you installed). Then add **VDPAU\\_DRIVER=va\\_gl** save and exit.\n\n[Arch Wiki guide to hardware acceleration for NVIDIA and AMD](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hardware_video_acceleration).\n\n[Check if your GPU and hardware acceleration driver can decode VP9](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hardware_video_acceleration#Comparison_tables) if it can't install the h264ify browser extension, [\\[1\\]](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/h264ify/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=search) [\\[2\\]](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/enhanced-h264ify/omkfmpieigblcllmkgbflkikinpkodlk) otherwise you won't be able to watch videos with hardware video decoding, keep in mind h264ify will disable resolutions above 1080p.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Step 5. Undervolting\n\n* **WARNING UNDERVOLTING CAN BRICK YOUR LAPTOP PERMANENTLY MAKING IT COMPLETELY UNUSABLE I WONT BE RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO BRICK YOUR LAPTOP.**\n* From Arch Wiki **\"Undervolting is a process where voltage to CPU is reduced in order to reduce its energy consumption and heat without affecting performance. Note that most desktop motherboards allow tweaking CPU voltage settings in BIOS as well.\"**\n* From Arch Wiki **\"It is no longer possible to undervolt Intel processors with modern BIOSes and microcode, due to the changes needed to patch the** [Plundervolt](https://plundervolt.com/) **vulnerability.\"**\n* There is a method to undervolt K10 and newer AMD CPUs, I'll leave a link to the [Arch Wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Undervolting_CPU#amdctl).\n* Do **not** use this guide to undervolt your AMD CPU.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nrun **sudo pacman -S intel-undervolt**\n\nKernels 5.9+ you need to add **msr.allow\\_writes=on** as a kernel parameter to your boot loader I'll leave the [Arch Wiki page for adding kernel parameters to your boot loader](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/kernel_parameters). After you added the parameter reboot your laptop.\n\nrun **sudo nano /etc/intel-undervolt.conf**\n\nDecrease the CPU mV by -10 like this.\n\n    undervolt 0 'CPU' -10\n\nSave and exit then run **sudo intel-undervolt apply &amp;&amp; sudo intel-undervolt read** and check it applied properly.\n\nNext stress test for system stability as undervolting can cause a system to crash or hang, run **yay -S mprime**\n\nrun **mprime**\n\nStress test for 30 minutes, then decrease the mV by -10 for every successful run until your laptop crashes or hangs, once you find the sweet spot you can enable the undervolt service run **sudo systemctl enable intel-undervolt.service** make **sure** your system runs stable before enabling this service as it can result in an unbootable or unstable system.\n\n[Arch Wiki page for undervolting](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Undervolting_CPU).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Step 6. Hibernation Suspend and Swap\n\n* Swap makes memory management for your laptop easier,[\\[1\\]](https://haydenjames.io/linux-performance-almost-always-add-swap-space/) [\\[2\\]](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/do-we-really-need-swap-modern-systems) [\\[3\\]](https://chrisdown.name/2018/01/02/in-defence-of-swap.html) if you're worried about SSD writes I'll show you how to reduce swappiness or turn off swapping (not recommended) so you can use swap for just hibernation.\n* For hibernation to work you **need** a swap, I'll show you how to enable hibernation for a swap partition and leave the swap file [Arch Wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate#Hibernation_into_swap_file).\n* People using LVM2 I left a separate guide as it's slightly different.\n* Swap files on btrfs are also different I'll leave the [Arch Wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate#Hibernation_into_swap_file_on_Btrfs).\n* Suspend should work without configuring anything, I'll show you how to fix it if it doesn't work properly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo enable hibernation run **sudo blkid** and grab the swap partitions **\"UUID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"**\n\nNext add **resume=UUID=xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx** as a kernel parameter to your boot loader here is the [Arch Wiki page for adding kernel parameters to yours](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/kernel_parameters).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**For LVM2** users run **sudo lsblk** and check where the swap partition is located.\n\nNext add **resume=/dev/YourVolumeGroup/yourLogicalVolume** as a kernel parameter to your boot loader here is the [Arch Wiki page for adding kernel parameters to yours](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/kernel_parameters).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext configure the initramfs I'll copy and paste how to configure it from the Arch Wiki since it does a better job at explaining than I can.\n\nrun **sudo nano /etc/mkinitcpio.conf**\n\n* From Arch Wiki **\"When an initramfs with the base hook is used, which is the default, the resume hook is required in /etc/mkinitcpio.conf. Whether by label or by UUID, the swap partition is referred to with a udev device node, so the resume hook must go after the udev hook. This example was made starting from the default hook configuration: HOOKS=(base udev autodetect keyboard modconf block filesystems resume fsck)**\n* **When an initramfs with the systemd hook is used, a resume mechanism is already provided, and no further hooks need to be added.**\n* **Note: LVM users should add the resume hook after lvm2.**\n\nrun **sudo mkinitcpio -P** and reboot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll show you how to decrease or turn off swapping here, if you're doing this to reduce SSD writes and not for a specific reason please read. [\\[1\\]](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=271192) [\\[2\\]](https://askubuntu.com/questions/184217/why-most-people-recommend-to-reduce-swappiness-to-10-20) [\\[3\\]](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/88693/why-is-swappiness-set-to-60-by-default) **IMO it's better to have better system performance at the sacrifice of an unnoticeable amount of SSD longevity.**\n\nrun **sudo nano /etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf**\n\nadd **vm.swappiness = \"Number\"**  |  From Arch Wiki **\"The swappiness sysctl parameter represents the kernel's preference (or avoidance) of swap space.

A low value causes the kernel to avoid swapping, a high value causes the kernel to try to use swap space, and a value of 100 means IO cost is assumed to be equal. Using a low value on sufficient memory is known to improve responsiveness on many systems.\"**\n\nadd **vm.vfs\\_cache\\_pressure = \"Number\"**  |  From Arch Wiki **\"Another sysctl parameter that affects swap performance is vm.vfs\\_cache\\_pressure, which controls the tendency of the kernel to reclaim the memory which is used for caching of VFS caches,versus pagecache and swap.

Running **echo XHC &gt; /proc/acpi/wakeup** fixed my suspend issues and I'll show how to make that a permanent solution later in this tutorial. *See in step 12*\n\n[Arch Wiki page for swap](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Swap).\n\n[Arch Wiki page for hibernation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate).\n\n[Arch Wiki page to hibernation into a thinly-provisioned LVM volume](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate#Hibernation_into_a_thinly-provisioned_LVM_volume).\n\n[Arch Wiki page to Hybrid-Sleep](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management#Hybrid-sleep_on_suspend_or_hibernation_request).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Step 7. Thermald (Intel Only)\n\n* Thermald prevents throttling, if you feel your laptop won't throttle you don't have to install this, I still recommend it as a \"just in case\".\n* From Arch Wiki **\"thermald is a Linux daemon used to prevent the overheating of Intel CPU's. This daemon monitors temperature and applies compensation using available cooling methods.\"**\n* From Arch Wiki **\"By default, it monitors CPU temperature using available CPU digital temperature sensors and maintains CPU temperature under control, before hardware takes aggressive correction action. If there is a skin temperature sensor in thermal sysfs, then it tries to keep skin temperature under 45C.\"**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nrun **sudo pacman -S thermald**\n\nrun **sudo systemctl enable --now thermald**\n\n[Arch Wiki page to Thermald](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/CPU_frequency_scaling#thermald).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Step 8. CPU Power Management\n\n* The purpose of this CPU power saving guide isn't to just to reduce thermals it's to make the fans spin up less in turn saving battery and having a more comfortable experience. Keep in mind this can reduce performance.\n* If you want to just disable your CPU's turbo boost feature see *step 12.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor Gnome and KDE run **sudo pacman -S power-profiles-daemon** then enable it by running **sudo systemctl enable --now power-profiles-daemon** if no settings appear for setting the CPU's power profile reboot your laptop.\n\nFrom the Arch Wiki **\"power-profiles-daemon conflicts with other power management services such as** [**TLP**](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/TLP)**,** [**tuned**](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tuned) **and** [**system76-power**](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/system76-power)**. To use one of the aforementioned services instead without uninstalling power-profiles-daemon (due to its potential status as a dependency), disable the power-profiles-daemon service by** [**masking**](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Mask) **it (see also** [\\[1\\]](https://github.com/linrunner/TLP/issues/564)**,** [\\[2\\]](https://linrunner.de/tlp/installation/arch.html#service-units)**).\"**\n\nI'm unsure how other desktop environments handle CPU power management so I'll leave an [Arch Wiki page for desktop environments](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/desktop_environment).\n\nFor desktop environments that don't support CPU power management I'll add how to set your CPU's power profile in *step 12*.\n\n[Arch Wiki page for CPU Frequency Scaling](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/CPU_frequency_scaling).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Step 9. GPU Power saving\n\n* For this whole step you would've needed to enable early KMS from *step 3*.\n* If you don't have an Intel GPU don't follow the steps I give here, instead use the Arch Wiki pages below for your brand of GPU.\n* **All of these options might cause serious stability issues on many laptops especially older ones please enable and test the options one by one to see what works and what might not, if you're using X.org tuning some settings might fix these issues I'll leave the** [Arch Wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xorg)**.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nrun **sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/i915.conf**\n\nadd **options i915 enable\\_guc=2**  |  From Arch Wiki **\"On supported Skylake and newer processors, some video features (e.g. CBR rate control on SKL low-power encoding mode) may require the use of an updated GPU firmware,** [\\[3\\]](https://github.com/intel/media-driver#known-issues-and-limitations) **which is loaded by default only on Gen 11+ hardware since Linux 5.4.** [\\[4\\]](https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/317523/) **Enabling GuC/HuC firmware loading can cause issues on some systems; disable it if you experience freezing (for example, after resuming from  hibernation).\"**\n\nadd **options i915 enable\\_fbc=1**  |  From Arch Wiki **\"Making use of Framebuffer compression (FBC) can reduce power consumption while reducing memory bandwidth needed for screen refreshes.\"**\n\nadd **options i915 enable\\_psr=1**  |  **\"allows the display to go to lower standby states when system is idle but display is on as it eliminates display refresh request to DDR memory completely\"** [**\\[1\\]**](https://01.org/linuxgraphics/gfx-docs/drm/gpu/i915.html)\n\nadd **options i915 enable\\_rc6=1**  |  **\"RC6 is a technology which allows the GPU to go into a very low power consumption state when the GPU is idle (down to 0V).\"** [**\\[1\\]**](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/PowerManagementRC6)\n\n[Arch Wiki page for Intel GPU's](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/intel_graphics).  |  Includes possible stability fixes that I mentioned.\n\n[Arch Wiki page for NVIDIA GPU's](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA).\n\n[Arch Wiki page for AMD GPU's](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AMDGPU).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Step 10.

They tried CentOS, RedHat and Ubuntu, none of the bootables were able to show a video output.\nI was like \"Maybe we can try Arch?\"\n\n\"What is Arch?\"\n\"No we're not such nerds\"\n\"No Ubuntu is the best distro, if Ubuntu can't start not even Arch could\" (and this last one was partially true with the original bootable)\nTo install Linux was actually a strong requirement because the products we're developing need a native linux ecosystem and Windows is not a viable option, but it was the only way to boot that computer.\n\nOther two days passed, and no progress was made.\nIn the meantime, I just added nvidia to packages.x86_64 and run secretely a mkarchiso on my stick.\nWaited for the right moment...\n\nAnd the day after, some of them had a meeting long enough to make me start the bootable, wipe out Windows and pacstrap a minimal KDE installation. They came out of the meeting room discussing \"some viable options to start such a new machine\", headed to the computer.\n\nAnd then silence, followed by a \"WTF?\"\n\nToday another computer (a smaller one) arrived and they asked me to install Arch on it.\n\nMany thanks to Arch and the Wiki maintainers!",

Even though pacman keeps track of this information, it doesn't show it by default.\n\nThis can happen because of \n\n* using `pacman -R` instead of `pacman -Rs` to remove packages (dependencies stay installed)\n* makedeps stay installed after building AUR packages\n* packages removing dependencies in newer versions (without you noticing)\n\nYou can remove them by doing `pacman -Qtdq | pacman -Rns -` but check the list carefully first since  some of those packages you might actually want to keep, especially if your installation is very old.\n\nI've added all this info to the [Pacman tips: Removing unused packages](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman/Tips_and_tricks#Removing_unused_packages_\\(orphans\\)) section of the Wiki. \n\nI've also created [pacman-log-orphans-hook^[AUR]](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pacman-log-orphans-hook) which logs the list of unused packages whenever pacman runs.",

    "body": "There is a critical bug running out right now on this version. If you have an AMD GPU, some of the recent patches added to amdgpu will make every single OpenGL/Vulkan accelerated program refuse to SIGKILL itself when prompted to, and will hang up and freeze your entire system.\n\nThis includes every single normal program that you use that isn't the terminal, even your app launcher. This happened to me after rebooting my computer today, and only rolling back to 6.16.8arch.1-1 solves this. Also i have seen some people talking about the same issue on the forum with very similar log outputs, so it might be happening for a ton of people right now.\n\nUpdate: 6.16.8arch.3-1 fixes that, you should update your system 🌩NOW ⚡️",

Originally meant to be a rewrite of yay, it's bound to be familiar to people of have used yay or other pacman wrapping AUR helpers.\n\nParu has seen a good amount of popularity and so far there's been 30 other contributors which I'm happy to see.\n\nThere's also been good amount of new features since the initial release. The notable ones being:\n\n- Print PKGBUILD\n- Print AUR comments\n- Print news on upgrade\n- Local repo and chroot support\n- Support for signing packages\n- Syntax highlighting with bat\n- Support for doas with `Sudo = doas` and `SudoLoop = true`\n\nI consider paru mostly feature complete at this point. The only things on my roadmap are [localization](https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru/discussions/424) and 32 bit binaries. Feel free to add to the discussion.\n\nI've also decided to set up [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Morganamilo) with some goals to see what people think and see if that goes anywhere. 5 poeple have already sponsored me so a big thank you to them.\n\nFor those interested in doing pacman/AUR things in rust. Paru is actually made up of several [libraries](https://crates.io/users/Morganamilo) which are in use in by a handful of other projects.\n\nThis includes official [rust libalpm bindings](https://github.com/archlinux/alpm.rs) for those who want to hack around with libalpm. There's also stuff for reading pacman.conf, srcinfo files, querying the AUR, downloading pkgbuilds, and dependency solving\n\nAlso friendly reminder that yes yay is still maintained.

    "title": "Is Arch Linux hitting the mainstream?",
    "body": "So I've noticed that in the past \\~2 weeks two major companies have announced their utilisation of Arch Linux *(for purposes specifically related to gaming)*.\n\nThe more famous announcement was *Valve* announcing the *Steam Deck*. As many on this forum might know, the *Steam Deck* will be using Arch Linux as the base for their own Linux distribution, SteamOS, with the intention to get *every single* Windows video game on Steam working on SteamOS via *(presumably)*, Proton. This news in it of itself is quite exciting as it has the potential of further legitimising the usage of Linux distributions for playing video games hopefully encouraging developers to pay closer attention to it.\n\nThe other, *and in my opinion more interesting*, announcement was by Nvidia. [https://youtu.be/VBfci5hYN1c](https://youtu.be/VBfci5hYN1c) They made a tech demo / showcase where a MediaTek ARM CPU was being used alongside an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti to play the game Wolfenstein: YoungBlood *(an x86\\_64 Windows game)* on Arch Linux (*on an ARM CPU!!)*. You can tell it's Arch Linux from the neofetch output. This was very interesting to me. I am presuming that Nvidia compiled their own version of Arch Linux from the source code on ARM although they might've been using the Arch Linux ARM Project. This means that they, firstly, translated the game's Windows API calls to things Linux can understand (presumably through Proton or Wine or something else) and secondly, the took a game that was designed for the x86\\_64 architecture and got it running on an ARM CPU. They also managed to get an Nvidia GPU running with an ARM CPU so this means they have PCI-E and potentially UEFI? *Sidenote: Nvidia's demo was meant to explore the capabilities of using RTX Chromebooks with ARM CPUs.*\n\nThis is quite interesting indeed and I don't doubt that both companies chose to use Arch Linux due to its flexibility as an OS platform with being very customisable and having the ability to be tailored to one's requirements.\n\nWhat are your opinions on this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: What I'm seeing in the comments has led me to believe that pure Arch *(given as is by the maintainers and the download .iso on* [*archlinux.org*](https://archlinux.org)*)* might not be the one hitting mainstream, but many entities will be basing their own distro's off of Arch due to its modularity and ease of compilation / customisation. \n\nI also forgot to mention *yet another* implementation of Arch Linux, especially on ARM, the *Asahi Linux Project* which aims to get Linux up and running on Apple M1 (ARM) MacBooks claims to be using Arch Linux as the base for their distro. Now sure, it's not being backed by some large company *(probably the opposite, in fact)*, but it's also an interesting use case that further emphasises the preference of developers to use Arch Linux as the base for *\"niche\"* distro use-cases.",

While I'm not exactly going to say I am a tech aficionado I'm sort of known as the \"computer\" guy, I have an IT degree (although I've never put it to real use) and I have a reputation for fixing pleb problems on my friends/family's laptops and PCs. It is usually something simple like installing Windows for them in a very \"clean\" manner, a hardware thing, or just to look for a workaround for a bug. I use Linux myself simply out of personal reasons, it's been a longtime interest of mine.\n\nThe hefty majority of use AMD computers. It wasn't until very recently that the Linux lightbulb went off  for everyone else besides me. It wasn't even to fix an issue or for any specific benefits, just an interest thing, it has quickly become part of our lives honestly. It's been happening for a while but what started really kicking things off recently was I was the only one in this age-group of my family to get access to the new Counter Strike 2 limited beta. With a small crowd of my family around me showing off Counter Strike 2, my brother remarked on how insane it was that the OS I was using to play it wasn't on Windows. That one remark snowballed. I said \"Yeah right?? It's as simple as this\" and then I opened up Steam and showed the \"Steam Play\" sections of the settings menu. \"It comes built right into Steam for Linux, it's called Proton. It pretty much can play any Windows game, besides a very small handful.\" This blew my brother's mind and became a huge talking point. He began pestering me in the most wonderful ways \"Can Linux do this\" \"Will I still be able to keep that\" pondering things and soon enough we all began talking about distros, where Arch comes in. I explained to them the difference between rolling distros and LTS/stable ones. He wasn't interested in distro/OS that \"got a new version every months or year\" I said that a rolling release gives you the benefit of a system that you install once and update forever, at the expense of having to \"stay on top of updates\", ie system maintenance. I said that this isn't really something you can just explain or learn in one sitting, it takes familiarity and experience. But it isn't \"hard\", it's as simple as the idea of being aware of what's on your system. This part went in one ear, right out the other for him 😂 We looked over at the elephant in the room, which is a nearly 7 year old Arch Linux installation on my PC, and then back at eachother. \".....yo why don't you just do it\"\n\nSo there goes my brother, now a happy Arch Linux Plasma desktop user with his newly riced out panel scheme he is obsessed with (I told him not to change too many defaults but he just kept on going lol) it was so nice and surreal to see that obsession on someone else in my family, that I'm not the only one who gets the tingles from seeing OSs that aren't Mac or Windows. He opted for KDE Plasma because of the mix of familiarity, and instant access to Freesync support for his monitor, and the sheer amount of customization. I personally use GNOME but I know that's quite a bold interface I wouldn't try to push it onto someone who doesn't seem interested. The rest of my family began to follow suit, Arch Linux and KDE and Proton became the main talking point of 2023.\n\nSara's bluetooth headphones were literally the only issue and it was because they were some weird knockoff brand from overseas. Everything else works out the box, for everyone. I swear to god I'm not exaggerating, it has been SIGNIFICANTLY less stressful to be the \"little bug fixer computer dude\" in the family, since I switched us all to Linux. I AM THE ONLY GNOME USER, EVERYONE ELSE PREFERRED PLASMA. I think that's hilarious but it is what it is lol. Friday is now update day, I go to 3 different apartments and update all the Arch installations for my family. I want to make a movie out of this or something, life is fucking awesome. The only one who hasn't boarded this bizarre penguin train is my cousin DJ. He simply doesn't want to change anything, the tried &amp; true aint-broke-don't-fix-it type. He'll come around 😎🐧",

    "body": "tl;dr: In PKGBUILD, remove `--user root` and use `chown -R root:root \"${pkgdir}\"` instead.\n\nI found that some nodejs packages were conflicting with each other months ago, but I didn't look into it and just went with `npm install -g` instead of AUR.\n\nYesterday, I met the conflict again and decided to have a look. When I saw `/usr/lib/node_modules/root/tests/index.js`, my first thought was \"oh, the tests are installed in a top-level directory shared among all nodejs packages, so they conflict\". But I soon found myself wrong: how could there be so many packages that don't conflict with each other, if they are all installed in the same directory?\n\nThen, I noticed `/usr/lib/node_modules/root/package.json`. Oops, it's [a package called \"root\"](https://www.npmjs.com/package/root). In the PKGBUILD, there was an \"option\" `--user root`, which seems to be an alternative for `chown -R root:root \"${pkgdir}\"`. But, npm doesn't accept this option [since npm v7](https://github.com/npm/cli/blame/5ae068ae57d309b2ab4bc3f34c27cd1d86bcd7b2/CHANGELOG.md#L2885). Believe it or not, npm doesn't complain about any option that it doesn't recognize. So, `--user root` does nothing but installing the package called root.\n\nThere must be many invalid packages, I thought. But guessing is useless, so I created a new directory and ran `paru -G $(paru -Ssq --aur nodejs-)`. There were 356 such packages, and 184 of them contain `--user root` in the PKGBUILD. What's more, 291 of them don't contain `chown`.\n\nAt first, I commented under many packages. But there were too many. And this somehow seems like spamming. Then I decided to adopt orphaned packages. I only chose the packages that have at least one vote and the upstream is not deprecated or unmaintained for years. The result is the title, and more details are in [my AUR repository](https://github.com/ouuan/AUR-packages).",

I'm 100% sure the password was right, after like 30 min trying to understand what was going on, it magically worked again. Anyway I just didn't care, didn't tried to see what was source of the problem and moved on.\n\nBut today it happened again, not once but twice. Same behavior again, it just doesn't accept the password, and after like 10 min it magically accepts the password again. \n\nThe only output I get is `Sorry try again`. And checking the `journalctl` I found this:\n```\npam_unix(sudo:auth): conversation failed\npam_unix(sudo:auth): auth could not identify password for [myuser]\n```\n\nThat's what `jounarlctl` shows when using sudo doesn't work. Trying to debug this I typed the password wrong on purpose to see what does `journalctl` shows. And when the password is typed wrong I get this: \n```\nmyuser : 1 incorrect password attempt ; TTY=pts/2 ; PWD=/home/myuser ; USER=root\n```\n\nAs you can see, the error message is different. It also confirms that I'm not typing my password wrong (I already was 100% sure of this).\n\nWhile I was writing this post I decided to check `journalctl` a little bit more in detail, looking for key words like *password* and *pam*. And soon enough I found hundreds of lines with the following:\n```\npam_unix(su:session): session closed for user root\n```\n\nBut also, I found just a few a lines with the same, but starting with CROND:\n\n```\nCROND[18486]: pam_unix(crond:session): session closed for user root\n```\nIn these lines the error was comming from the crond service. Long story short, the whole problem was crond failing to execute a command as root for a script I had, which caused the pam module to kick in and block sudo access everywhere for the default fail timeout period. \n\nFirst I was writing this to ask for help, but solved the problem in the middle and since I already had almost the whole post I decided to change it from asking for help, to giving an advice. Specially for new users, which I see a lot of them comming in lately. Remember! always check jurnalctl when weird things start happening, It is amazing to debug problems.",

I set `MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1` and now watching Twitch (with that extension) only uses around 15-20% cpu, much more reasonable when running on a laptop on battery. Thought I would mention this here in case someone else is having this issue.\n\nps: you can check if you're using xwayland or the native wayland backend by going to about:support in firefox and searching for \"wayland\"",

    "body": "I am doing Computer Science and I am currently in my Junior year(3rd year).  I was working on my Arch in Library and a student in his sophomore year(2nd year) saw me using Arch and as he too was an Arch enthusiast, he got curious. So, he started asking me various questions. One of the questions that he asked was what DE environment am I using. Am I using a tiling manager or just windows-like WM. To which I answered that I don't use a tiling manager, stock KDE is fine for me. To which he replied what's the point of using Arch if you aren't using a tiling manager, stick to windows.\n\nThis statement felt very weird and dumb to me coz is he really trying to justify his usage of Arch by a WM which can be configured on any Linux Distro? There are many reasons for using Arch but tiling manager is not one of them lmao.\n\nTo the curious ones, I don't use a tiling manager because my laptop screen is only 14\" and it doesn't make sense to use a tiling manager for such a small display (for larger displays it make sense), at least according to me.\n\nAnd yeah, I didn't have time to make him understand this coz he was in a hurry.\n\n\nEdit: Ok, I was wrong, it does make sense for a tiling manager to be used on smaller display. I just never gave it much thought as I was fine with stock-KDE plasma and I didn't like dividing my display into smaller windows. (Max I like to do is use 2 application in split mode)",

    "body": "Since I've seen people [still discussing this](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/x8h9y7/is_grub_fixed/), [mods denying](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/x8h9y7/comment/inkgmgd/) the [clear upstream bug](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2022-08/msg00374.html), and even people confused in the [arch bug report](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/75701). I've the decided to explain the problem in the best way I know how: with code.\n\nSo we have a menu:\n\n    menuentry \"1. Arch Linux\"\n    menuentry \"2. UEFI Firmware Settings\"\n\nIf we select `1` we start Arch Linux, if we select `2` we enter the UEFI firmware. The command that starts the firmware is called `fwsetup`.\n\n    case $option in\n    \t1) arch ;;\n    \t2) fwsetup ;;\n    esac\n\nNow, this works, but the second menu entry is only generated in machines with UEFI UI support which happened to have booted into UEFI mode (as opposed to legacy BIOS mode) and in August 17 GRUB developers thought it wise to always generate the menu entry regardless of how you booted when you generated the menu: [Improve logic to check for fwsetup support](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2022-08/msg00169.html).\n\nThis has the problem that if UEFI UI is not supported, the menu entry will be displayed, but it will throw an error. So somebody had the idea to decide whether or not to display the menu entry at runtime, by adding an option to `fwsetup` which already has to check for UEFI UI support anyway (to throw the error), so instead of this:\n\n    fwsetup() {\n    \techo \"Starting UEFI firmware\"\n    \techo \"REBOOTING\" &gt;&amp;2\n    \texit\n    }\n\nWe have this:\n\n    fwsetup() {\n    \tif [[ \"$1\" = --is-supported ]]; then\n    \t\ttest -n \"$efi_ui_supported\"\n    \t\treturn $?\n    \tfi\n    \n    \tif [[ -z \"$efi_ui_supported\" ]]; then\n    \t\techo \"ERROR: EFI UI not supported\" &gt;&amp;2\n    \t\treturn 1\n    \tfi\n    \n    \techo \"Starting UEFI firmware UI\"\n    \techo \"REBOOTING\" &gt;&amp;2\n    \texit\n    }\n\nNow the menus are like:\n\n    menuentry \"1. Arch Linux\"\n    \n    fwsetup --is-supported &amp;&amp;\n    menuentry \"2. UEFI Firmware Settings\"\n\nOn machines with UEFI UI support, two entries will be shown, and otherwise just one.\n\nGreat... **If** you run `grub-install` which updates the `fwsetup` command and `grub-mkconfig` which regenerates the menu.\n\nBut what happens if you only do `grub-mkconfig`? (which is run automatically in many Arch-based distros), well then your menu is going to call `fwsetup --is-supported`, which doesn't have that option, so it's going to do:\n\n    fwsetup() {\n    \techo \"Starting UEFI firmware UI\"\n    \techo \"REBOOTING\" &gt;&amp;2\n    \texit\n    }\n\nSo... While trying to display the menu GRUB is going to reboot to start the UEFI firmware UI.\n\nThis is a **BUG**. Upstream has already [acknowledged so](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2022-08/msg00374.html) and are thinking on removing the call to `fwsetup --is-supported` in the menu.\n\nBut it has not yet been fixed in upstream: [30\\_uefi-firmware.in](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/grub.git/tree/util/grub.d/30_uefi-firmware.in) is still calling `fwsetup --is-supported`, and it's not fixed in Arch Linux either. All Arch Linux maintainers did was add a note saying people need to make sure to run `grub-install`, but what if you don't read that?\n\nThe proper fix is to **revert** these changes and return to a version of [30\\_uefi-firmware.in](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/grub.git/tree/util/grub.d/30_uefi-firmware.in?id=46d76f8fef7663b60d025cd425b348029c296350) which is known to work, so before 2022-08-18. In this version `fwsetup` is only called if you select the menu entry, never otherwise.\n\nI've sent a patch to Arch Linux maintainers in yet another bug report: [FS#75862 - \\[grub\\] revert upstream bug which causes GRUB to reboot](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/75862). This way it's not necessary to call `grub-install` to make sure your system boots.\n\n**Update**: My task was closed immediately because according to Arch Linux maintainers it's a \"duplicate\" of task [FS#75701](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/75701): it's not. That task was \"fixed\" by adding a note to run `grub-install`, my task is about fixing the package properly by not requiring to run `grub-install` and thus be backwards-compatible.\n\n**Note**: There are two deviations. one in the case your UEFI doesn't have a UI, in that case if you have an old version of GRUB installed in your EFI partition, `fwsetup`  is not available and GRUB will not attempt to restart to display a non-existent UEFI firmware UI, you'll simply not see the menu entry (presumably). The second one is that if you are on a BIOS platform, I don't know what happens if you run `fwsetup` there, but I've heard that the system crashes (instead of rebooting). I also don't know what happens if you run `fwsetup --is-supported` in BIOS, even if you do `grub-install` you might have problems, another patch to avoid that [has been proposed](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2022-08/msg00384.html).\n\nHere's the full script if you want to simulate what GRUB does in different interactions:\n\n    efi_ui_supported=1\n    \n    menuentry() {\n    \techo \"$1\"\n    }\n    \n    fwsetup_1() {\n    \techo \"Starting UEFI firmware UI\"\n    \techo \"REBOOTING\" &gt;&amp;2\n    \texit\n    }\n    \n    fwsetup_2() {\n    \tif [[ \"$1\" = --is-supported ]]; then\n    \t\ttest -n \"$efi_ui_supported\"\n    \t\treturn $?\n    \tfi\n    \n    \tif [[ -z \"$efi_ui_supported\" ]]; then\n    \t\techo \"ERROR: EFI UI not supported\" &gt;&amp;2\n    \t\treturn 1\n    \tfi\n    \n    \techo \"Starting UEFI firmware UI\"\n    \techo \"REBOOTING\" &gt;&amp;2\n    \texit\n    }\n    \n    fwsetup() {\n    \tfwsetup_1 \"$@\"\n    }\n    \n    arch() {\n    \techo \"Starting Arch Linux\"\n    }\n    \n    menuentry \"1. Arch Linux\"\n    \n    fwsetup --is-supported &amp;&amp;\n    menuentry \"2. UEFI Firmware Settings\"\n    \n    echo -n \"Select one: \"\n    read -r -n1 option\n    echo\n    \n    case $option in\n    \t1) arch ;;\n    \t2) fwsetup ;;\n    esac",

    "body": "I've been using M$ Windows for more than two decades. However, the user experience just got worse and worse over it's iterations, and the creepy telemetry built in Windows 10 is the dealbreaker for me. I decided once and for all to leave the DARK SIDE, and join the rank of happy penguins.\n\nThis is not my first time installing Linux. I've tried several distroes over the past decades, just out of curiosity. Ubuntu, Fedora, and openSUSE are the ones that I've tried with good CJK language support. I also tried Manjaro and MXLinux, but their CJK input method support is not functionally complete, and this is a no-go for me, as I'm Asian. Anyway, I've never used any of them long enough to replace my workflow on M$ Windows. And my skill in Linux command line was near to none, just a noob.\n\nThis time, it's for real. Initially I wanted to try using Fedora Linux for an extended period to get myself acclimated to the Linux DE, command line and workflow, as Fedora was the distro that's a little bit harder than Ubuntu, but not scarily hard. However, I have three hard drives and one SSD installed in my desktop PC, and I'd like to use three HDDs as a single LV (it wasn't too bad to use them separately under Windows as different drives). During installation, I found that there is no easy way to install the EFI and /root on the SSD, while setup a LV comprised of three HDDs and mount it correctly in Fedora's GUI installer. I found little information on this for Fedora during googling, but I found a lot of information and tutorial for Arch Linux.\n\nI've heard that Arch is an \"advanced\" distro, and thus never considered it as an option in the past. But since there are so many documents on Arch website and video tutorials on Youtube, I decided to give it a try. It surely was a little bit scary to see an black prompt rather than colorful graphical installer, but I tried to follow the documents and tutorials relevant to my scenario. So, a noob is installing Arch. Ouch! \n\nThe first installation was successful. I didn't bother try to build a LV, just installed it on a single SSD, with the simplest partition scheme and GRUB as bootloader. Just copy every step from YT tutorial videos, it's totally doable. Then I tried to use btrfs but not ext4 for root partition, and also created a LV and mounted it during installation. I was able to boot it with GRUB, but I made the swap partition too large, 8G for a system with 32G RAM, which makes no sense (of course, I reached that conclusion by more reading and watching more video tutorials.) I was a little too confident at that moment, tried another new installation with swapfile on btrfs. O boy, that was laborious and I didn't set up systemd-boot correctly, thus a total failure. GRUB was able to recognize the efi, but still hanged some point during systemd. For the fourth time, I did a btrfs install with no swap, created a LVM and mounted it, and using systemd-boot as bootloader. The fourth installation was a mixed-bag. I installed two kernels, 5.10 LTS and 5.11. I can boot with 5.10 LTS kernel and install desktop environment, but not with 5.11. 5.11 hangs during systemd, prompted me an error message of not being able to initialize LV and not being able to mount it to its mount point, then goes into emergency shell.\n\nAt this point, I've typed more commands in four days than the past two decades combined. Although I still can't figure out what is the reason that 5.10LTS kernel boots but 5.11 doesn't, but I think I'll just settle down for now as I'm too tired for another round of installation, and start using Arch Linux as my daily driver. Manually generate locale also provide CJK language input support on par with Fedora/Ubuntu/openSUSE, the three distroes with respective commercial versions. Perfect CJK support is the prerequisite of a working machine for me, and Arch delivers, since locale is generated during manual installation.\n\nOver the past two decades, I hardly learned anything of Linux from limited exposure of distroes wrapped under GUI. But just installing Arch Linux four times, at least I learned how to set up a reasonable partition scheme using command line, and gained some knowledge of what was happening under the hood of calamares.\n\nFrom this experience, I think the fastest way for a newcomer to learn the basics of Linux is simply start right away from installing Arch Linux on a simple machine with only one single SSD, but not from using \"beginner friendly\" distroes. If I could complete the same task without changing my habit from using Windows GUI for so long, I won't change that habit under Ubuntu/Manjaro.\n\nI hope the next update of kernel could magically fix the problem of dead hang during systemd init. But 5.10 LTS is doing fine for now, and that's enough for me.",

    "body": "So first of all, I'm an idiot. I unironically bought a new Macbook Pro in 2017. I know, I know. I should have known better. In 2015 I daily drove Ubuntu on an old Dell laptop and that experience was less than pleasant. I walked away thinking, \"I'll keep my Ubuntu servers, but the desktop is just too much of a headache.\"\n\nFast foward to 2018. I get a once in a lifetime chance to visit a foreign country with my dad. No way I'm bringing a $2500 laptop with me, so I bought one of the 2011 Lenovo no HDD specials on eBay, threw a SSD in there, and installed Pop!_OS. Sure as hell wasn't going to run Windows.\n\nAfter we checked into a hotel, my dad asked to use the laptop to check his emails, the news, etc. He commented how nice the computer was, \"Where did you get this?\" Lol. I had to agree, it was really nice to use, and even though it was 1/10th the price of my Fruit-adjacent laptop, when I took it home, I started using it more than the other, and I thought to myself, \n\n\"I'll never buy another Mac or Windows PC again, it'll be something Linux based. I need to incrementally change my workflow now so that when that day comes, I'm ready to switch full time.\"\n\nAs nice as Pop!_OS was at the time, I thought it was important to expand my understanding of what was available, so I started distro hopping. Initially, I kept hearing people on Reddit and on various forums talk about how much they loved XFCE, so I started there with Xubuntu. I tried Mint, Ubuntu MATE, Deepin, and a few more, and started to notice everything was Ubuntu based. At the time, the other talked-up and popular distro was Manjaro, and when I tried that, everything changed for me. I had the choice between 3 different Desktop Environments out of the box. It was easy to set up graphics drivers, and change the kernel. Something about pacman I liked a lot more than apt. \n\nHere comes this year. I have 6 children and all told, 3 desktops and 3 laptops that run on Manjaro for our family to use for school and to game together. To some degree, I'm a bona-fide Manjaro fanboy at this point. But, as time went on, I started to notice some disadvantages to it, and the additional overhead of having everything done for you, which is of course a big pro in a lot of ways, but also meant all the systems came with a lot of extra configuration just to brand it as Manjaro and give it the \"Manjaro\" experience. I was longing for a more \"stock\" Arch experience, but doubted my own abilities.\n\nWell, about a year later, I gave it a try, just followed the installation guide, and darn if plain old Arch doesn't run even better than the Manjaro machines, the other nice thing was only dealing with things I had explicitly installed myself, which made configuration and debugging way easier.\n\nSo, I shouldn't have doubted myself. And, I shouldn't have doubted you either, Arch.",

It was a hell of a lot better than managing software on Windows! Well, now it's It's been over a year since I switched but I'm still blown away by how quickly pacman installs packages. I\\`m not talking about download speeds, but the installation itself. Apart from when running dkms hooks for a new kernel, pacman installs packages amazingly fast compared to apt, which is very sluggish by comparison. What is the secret? Does it have something to do with how the packages are compressed, or is it configured to make better use of multiple cores, or something else? I really want to know. And if it's possible to be this fast, how come the apt devs haven't implemented the necessary changes to their package manager? What am I missing?",

I must admit that I don't understand all the commands I've used, and there are so many ways to install things that some times I can't follow some tutorials and I don't even understand why (you are told to write \"X\" command that should give you certain output and I get an error :P)\n\nAll this said, it is a shame that Linux doesn't get the attention it deserves, it should be the superior platform in all areas (and in some areas is, like servers) but on the consumer side is missing support from developers, specially big ones. I hope Valve keeps pushing Linux and helps to improve gaming even more. The more people use Linux, the bigger the incentive for companies to support Linux will be.\n\nAnd I'm sorry for my comments towards Linux, it's actually cool. All this said, Windows is extremely easy compared to Linux, which I understand it makes many people hesitant of using it. In my case I've used Windows since 3.1, so I'm comfortable with it and I know how to solve most of the problems people use to have with the platform.

I ended up discovering a bug that occurs during a long lived series of interactions with an external API. The bug takes a long time to reproduce (~40 minutes).

Whilst there is some annoyance with it arguably not following the Unix Philosophy, seemingly every step away from simplicity has been used to increase usability and performance.\n\nI want to point out that systemd has:\n\n- Readable, simple, feature-rich and consistent configuration files for nearly the whole system\n\n- \"Backwards\" compatibility to syslog, fstab, hostname, shutdown, and more\n\n- Parallel startup \n\n- Generates units from files that used to be line-by-line executed, converting common misconfigurations to their probable intent\n\nRegarding that last one: I just stumbled across that systemd at boot converts fstab into .mount files, autogenerating their dependencies. This means that fstab mis-ordering is solved by systemd's dependency resolution, preventing a whole category of mis-configurations (loopback mount to file on partition mounted later: fixed. Accidentally wrote up mounting your games disk before your home partition: fixed.)\n\nIt just seems no matter what I need to do in linux, systemd is ready to assist me. The only thing missing is networkd getting more polished before my whole base system is systemd.",

    "body": "It was time to knuckle down , work it out and move away from Microsoft watching me. The trigger was i had a notepad doc called to-do. Latest entry was \"buy new fridge\" at that point i didnt search for anything fridge related but oddly a couple of hours later i was getting adverts on sites for fridges.. that was me done no more windows .\n\nAnyway after some distro hopping mostly ubuntu distros (very easy to install) i was bogged down with the bloat and knew arch would be ideal but put off by reports of how complex it was. Long and short of it 2 weeks in and ALOT of reading i have arch installed , under 800 packages I3 setup with polybar (tiled windows managers are AMAZING!) learnt so much on how the system works and just rebuilt my PC to exactly how i want it by using a post install script to install my packages, setup yay and copy the config files i edited to their correct locations. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would say armed with the arch wiki and a bit of common sense its the best distro for anyone new to linux . For the first time in 25+ years i feel i know whats installed on my PC and what it does. Anyone wanting to use arch for the first time i strongly suggest documenting every config file you edit and every package you use with details on what it does . Makes reinstall a breeze. \n\nMy next step is to learn this VIM editor i keep hearing about . Currently using nano &amp; notepadqq. \n\nReason for post is i was wondering how other new users to linux jumping into the deep end with arch are finding it.",

Here’s the breakdown:\n\n1. **Endless forms** with useless questions that took **10+ hours** to complete.\n2. **IQ-style test** (for some reason).\n3. **Language test**—seriously, why?\n\nAfter passing those, I moved to the interview stages:\n\n1. **Technical interview** – Python coding.\n2. **Manager interview** – Career discussions (with the hiring team).\n3. **Another tech interview** – System architecture and general tech questions.\n4. **HR interview** – Career-related topics, but HR had no clue about salary expectations.\n5. **Another manager interview** (not in the hiring team).\n6. **Hiring lead interview** – Positive feedback.\n7. **VP interview** – **Very positive feedback**, I was literally told, *\"You tick all the boxes for this position.\"*\n\nEventually, I **received an offer**. Since I was already employed, I resigned to start in four weeks. Even though the salary—revealed **only after four months**—was underwhelming, it was a bit higher than my previous job, so I accepted. The emotional toll of the long process made me push forward.\n\n# And then, the disaster…\n\nOne week after accepting the offer, I woke up to an email from the hiring manager stating that, after further discussions with upper management, they had decided to cancel my application.\n\nWhat upper management? No one ever mentioned this step. And why did this happen after I received an offer?\n\nI sent a few polite and respectful emails asking for an explanation. No response. Neither from my hiring manager nor HR.\n\nNow, I’m left starting from scratch (if not worse), struggling to pay my bills.\n\n# My advice if you’re considering Canonical:\n\n* Prepare emotionally for a very long process.\n* Expect childish behavior like this.\n* Never resign until you’ve actually started working.\n\nI would never recommend Canonical to anyone I care about. If you're considering applying, I highly recommend checking Reddit and Glassdoor for feedback on their hiring process to make your own judgment.\n\nP.S. :\n\n\\- If your company is recruiting in europe, and you can share that info or refer me. please do !",

    "body": "*Brussels — April 1, 2025*\n\n\n\nIn a move that’s shaking up the tech world and raising eyebrows in Silicon Valley, the Belgian government has announced a groundbreaking new tariff: a **“Freedom Fee”** on all commercial software developed in the United States.\n\n\n\nEffective immediately, the new regulation introduces a 17.76% tax on American-made proprietary software sold or used in Belgium — a number officials insist is “purely symbolic” and definitely not a cheeky nod to US independence.\n\n\n\n“We believe in supporting software that reflects European values: openness, collaboration, and the joy of reading through thousands of lines of undocumented C code,” said Minister of Digital Affairs, Luc Verstegen, in a press conference held entirely via a LibreOffice Impress presentation. “This is not a punishment — it’s an encouragement to embrace open source. Also, Microsoft Excel crashed on us during the budget meetings.”\n\n\n\n**A Loophole for Libre**\n\n\n\nUnder the new policy, open-source software is fully exempt. Government agencies have reportedly already begun transitioning from Adobe products to GIMP and Inkscape, with mixed emotional results.\n\n\n\nPublic schools will phase out commercial learning software in favor of “whatever runs on Linux Mint,” and the Finance Ministry has proudly announced that all future taxes will now be calculated using LibreOffice Calc macros, described by one insider as “a heroic but deeply confusing experience.”\n\n\n\n**US Tech Giants Respond**\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for a major US software company, who asked not to be named (but their name rhymes with “Macrosoft”), warned that this could spark a digital trade war.\n\n\n\n“We support freedom — freedom to license, freedom to upsell, and freedom to crash during updates,” they said in a tersely worded Clippy-shaped press release.\n\n\n\n**FOSS Community Rejoices**\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, open-source developers worldwide are celebrating. GitHub has reported a spike in Belgian forks of previously dormant repos, including a sudden revival of interest in a 2003 Perl-based accounting tool named “MooseBudget.”\n\n\n\nLocal developer communities are planning a national holiday called “Libre Day,” during which Belgians will ceremonially uninstall commercial versions of antivirus software and replace them with open-source alternatives. Whether it’s a bold stand for digital sovereignty or just an elaborate April Fools’ prank with exceptional patch notes, one thing is clear: Belgium has officially ctrl-alt-deleted business as usual.\n\n\\#AprilFools #DigitalSovereignty #OpenSource #TechPolicy #GovTech #SoftwareTax #Innovation #MadeInBelgium #FOSS #DigitalTransformation #CyberHumor #LinkedInHumor #EUtech \n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaspernuyens\\_aprilfools-digitalsovereignty-opensource-activity-7312789588660355072-rohB/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=member\\_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAACO1wBefRMas4ftt\\_uS1IGBYyC\\_ziPY5k](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaspernuyens_aprilfools-digitalsovereignty-opensource-activity-7312789588660355072-rohB/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAACO1wBefRMas4ftt_uS1IGBYyC_ziPY5k)\n\n",

(This would normally take an hour on a typical setup!)\n\nI actually did a separate post on this in r/homelab with more technical details/prices if you’re curious - https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1hmnnwg/built_a_powerful_and_silent_amd_epyc_home_server/\n\n**Part 2: We Created a Minimalist Linux Distro for It!**\n\nWe also developed and open-sourced a lightweight Linux distribution tailored for this server, called Sbnb Linux. You can check it out here: https://github.com/sbnb-io/sbnb\n\n**Why Sbnb Linux?**\n\nSbnb Linux is designed for simplicity, focusing on booting bare-metal servers and setting up remote connectivity with zero hassle using Tailscale. Even more remarkable, it comes pre-configured for Confidential Computing (AMD SEV-SNP) right out of the box. Learn more at README-CC.\n\n**How It Works:**\n\n- Write the sbnb.raw image to a USB flash drive.\n- Add your Tailscale key as plaintext to the drive.\n- Boot your server from the USB.\n- Within minutes, your server appears in your Tailscale machine list.\n- SSH to your server using Tailscale OAuth (e.g., Google Auth).\n- Bonus: With one Docker command, you can seamlessly switch Sbnb Linux to any other distro (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS, Alpine). See the https://github.com/sbnb-io/sbnb/ for details!\n\nThis combo of high-performance hardware and a minimalist OS has been incredibly satisfying to build.\n\nIf you’ve worked on something similar or have any questions about our setup, I’d be delighted to hear from you!\n\nI also extend a warm welcome to anyone interested in joining this exciting opportunity to develop a new Linux distro focused on confidential computing and resilience!",

Any posts mentioning DistroWatch and multiple groups associated with Linux and Linux discussions have either been shut down or had many of their posts removed.\n\n&gt; We've been hearing all week from readers who say they can no longer post about Linux on Facebook or share links to DistroWatch. Some people have reported their accounts have been locked or limited for posting about Linux.\n\n&gt; The sad irony here is that Facebook runs much of its infrastructure on Linux and often posts job ads looking for Linux developers.\n\n&gt; Unfortunately, there isn't anything we can do about this, apart from advising people to get their Linux-related information from sources other than Facebook. I've tried to appeal the ban and was told the next day that Linux-related material is staying on the cybersecurity filter. My Facebook account was also locked for my efforts.",

It's just...\n\nI think in the life of every Linux person (or maybe it appeals to other hobbies/passions) there comes a time, when you're just simply DONE. Done reinstalling the system every couple of weeks. Done finding the best, newest trend there is. Done spending hours and hours troubleshooting and fixing issues with your extremely customized setup. Done scouring the forums and Reddit looking for answers on why this absolute newest, bleeding edge RC kernel is causing you problems. Just DONE.\n\nI've been distrohopping since I can remember. I had a brief year of using Arch (but not really, I was hopping between all Arch-based distros), then about a year or two using Fedora, but still trying out everything new that was coming out. I was in awe with all the new and shiny.\n\nBut now I'm in my 30s. I don't have time, nor headspace to wonder if my system will boot today, if the update won't break anything, if this new kernel won't cause me some weird, unexplainable issues. My OS has to boot and get out of my way. It's my terminal to the work, not my work.\n\nSo here I am. Writing this on Waterfox (basically Firefox ESR) from Linux Mint 22.1 with LTS kernel, installed on absolutely ridiculously powerful gaming machine. Do I care if I don't get new bells and whistles that come with newer kernels, newer DE versions, newer Firefox releases? No. I absolutely do not. I value the fact, that in about a year of having this Mint installation, I have NEVER had to reinstall it or fix anything. It just works. I feel no incentive to change anything here. I even use the default theming.\n\nSo, what's your story? Am I the only one, who came up to this mindset? Or maybe there are more of us? I leave the comments to you.\n\n  \nEDIT: I see there's a confusion. \"Why would you have to reinstall every couple of weeks?! Just learn to use Linux!\"  \nGuys... I'm working as sysadmin for 8 years, I know how to use Linux :P I didn't HAVE TO or NEED to reinstall my system. I just WANTED TO. To try new distro, new DE, new function, change something in my life. It was purely for fun and games. But I don't have time, nor headspace for this anymore, so I don't do this.

It's an infinite, whiteboard desktop app written in Qt/C++.\n  \n## Motivation\nLinux has had some apps with whiteboard features, like Xournal++ and Lorien. However, they have issues such as not having an infinite canvas (Xournal++) or lacking enough features (Lorien). That's why I decided to build Drawy, especially for Linux users. It's similar to Excalidraw but runs natively on your desktop, making it fast and lightweight. It's still in the alpha stage, but I have implemented key features that everyone needs:\n- Basic tools like pen, rectangle, ellipse, line, arrow, and text\n- Wacom tablet support with pressure sensitivity\n- An infinite canvas\n- Undo/redo support\n- Save/load files\n\nEven though this seems very basic, it took an enormous amount of effort to develop. Drawy is still very stable to use (I've used it a lot to teach my students!)\n\n## GitHub\nThe project is completely open source and licensed under the GNU General Public License V3.

I recently migrated to Arch and wanted to give it a go again. \n\nInstallation process was quite smooth actually. Aside from some RDP issues(I kept using the wrong IP) it works great. It really works as advertised, runs like a native application. \n\nI am running this on an X230 so it eats into my 8GB of RAM.\n\nIs anyone else using WinApps? I think this should be much more popular considering the amount of people whose only reason to stick to Windows is because of Office apps.",

    "title": "Wayland: An Accessibility Nightmare",
    "body": "Hello r/linux,\n\nI'm a developer working on accessibility software, specifically a cross-platform dwell clicker for people who cannot physically click a mouse. This tool is critical for users with certain motor disabilities who can move a cursor but cannot perform clicking actions.\n\n## How I Personally Navigate Computers\n\nMy own computer usage depends entirely on assistive technology:\n\n- I use a Quha Zono 2 (a gyroscopic air mouse) to move the cursor\n- My dwell clicker software simulates mouse clicks when I hold the cursor still \n- I rely on an on-screen keyboard for all text input\n\nThis combination allows me to use computers without traditional mouse clicks or keyboard input. XLib provides the crucial functionality that makes this possible by allowing software to capture mouse location and programmatically send keyboard and mouse inputs. It also allows me to also get the cursor position and other visual feedback. If you want an example of how this is done, [pyautogui has a nice class that demonstrates this](https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui/blob/master/pyautogui/_pyautogui_x11.py).\n\n## The Issue with Wayland\n\nWhile I've successfully implemented this accessibility tool on Windows, MacOS, and X11-based Linux, Wayland has presented significant barriers that effectively make it unusable for this type of assistive technology.\n\nThe primary issues I've encountered include:\n\n- Wayland's security model restricts programmatic input simulation, which is essential for assistive technologies\n- Unlike X11, there's no standardized way to inject mouse events system-wide\n- The fragmentation across different Wayland compositors means any solution would need separate implementations for GNOME, KDE, etc.\n- The lack of consistent APIs for accessibility tools creates a prohibitive development environment\n- Wayland doesn't even have a quality on-screen keyboard yet, forcing me to use X11's \"onboard\" in a VM for testing\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nFor users who rely on assistive technologies like me, this effectively means Wayland-based distributions become inaccessible. While I understand the security benefits of Wayland's approach, the lack of consideration for accessibility use cases creates a significant barrier for disabled users in the Linux ecosystem.\n\n## The Hard Truth\n\nI developed this program specifically to finally make the switch to Linux myself, but I've hit a wall with Wayland. If Wayland truly is the future of Linux, then nobody who relies on assistive technology will be able to use Linux as they want—if at all.\n\nThe reality is that creating quality accessible programs for Wayland will likely become nonexistent or prohibitively expensive, which is exactly what I'm trying to fight against with my open-source work. I always thought Linux was the gold standard for customization ~~and accessibility~~, but this experience has seriously challenged that belief.\n\nDoes the community have any solutions, or is Linux abandoning users with accessibility needs in its push toward Wayland?",

This attitude can manifest as a dismissive or condescending behavior towards new or less experienced users or even experienced users who likes to use GUIs or simpler distros like Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Fedora, and preferring CLIs and more technically demanding setups that requires you to compile all programs from source.\n\nAs far as I can tell, Linus Torvalds isn't an elitist and Linux elitists would probably not like him too, since he admits to not using Debian, Arch, or Gentoo because he prefers distributions that are easier to install and configure. In an interview, he mentioned that he doesn't like Linux distros that are hard to install and configure, as he wants a distro that just works out of the box so he can move on with his life and focus on kernel development. He has stated that he never installs \"hard\" distros like Debian, Arch or Gentoo, which is known for its requirement to compile all programs from source. Torvalds prefers Fedora, which he uses on most of his computers, as it has been fairly good for supporting PowerPC and keeps things easy to install and reasonably up-to-date. He also appreciates Ubuntu for making Debian more user-friendly.\n\nThis makes me feel better about myself. I've been a Linux user since 2012, and I don't know how to compile programs from source and I prefer GUI over Terminal for much of my day to day life. Just like Linus, I just want a Linux distro that works out of the box and gives me no headaches to set up.",

    "body": "My story with mobile linux started a decade ago when i was roughly 18, and I was getting into linux and mentioned to my friend that \"I wish I had linux on a phone\", and they mentioned SailfishOS. Back then I didn't even know english, had no money, and the only SFOS (sailfishos shortened) available was released year ago Jolla Phone.\n\nSo how do I get my hand on SFOS? Well the only option was to port it to my phone. Action of porting is adjusting OS to a device so that every feature works, unlike desktop, where thanks to ACPI and drivers and generalized hardware stuff generally just works. Phones are not really generalized hardware and each has its quirks so it needs a wee bit of work.\n\nSo I've acquired, then vastly uninteresting Motorola Moto G2, back when Motorola was under Google. And with my trash english in hand and my motorola in other I went to #sailfishos-porters on freenode IRC.\n\nNow up till this point I've had quite an experience flashing custom ROMs on my old htc explorer. So I went to IRC and started porting sfos with help of very nice and very helpful people there.\n\nNow fast forward cause I don't want this to be too long, I've ported g2, then went to port nexus 7, moto x2, moto x force, huawei p8 lite, moto z, moto x, moto x play, moto x pro, moto g2 LTE, moto g3, fxtec pro1 asus zenfone 5z, 8, and recently oneplus 6 and xiaomi pad 6. Yeah, I've been busy.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lhy6m920p4lf1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b65fafc5514dec873d1f40cc3715a7f5542550f2\n\nBeside doing more ports than Jolla (SailfishOS owner) at the time, I've been studying software engineering and decided to make an app, then another, and another. Currently I've developed 10 apps, and as of today I'm supporting 6 devices, including Motorola moto G2 from a decade ago. Yes its still alive. Yes I'm still using it daily. Some of my apps worth noting are youtube client and telegram client. Youtube client people praise to be better than android/ios ones.\n\nPeople when talking about mobile linux just tend to flat out ignore the biggest alternative to android/IOS we have to date like it never even existed which is very weird, and tad annoying. Some people say that \"SailfishOS is proprietary\" but no, no it's not. I couldn't have contributed to it if it was closed source don't you think? Yes, it's partially proprietary but in places you wouldn't even notice. All the OS part and hardware adaptation is \\*opensource, thanks to that, other OSs like ubuntu touch or mobian or halium could exist, because people forgot where libhybris comes from, and it comes from Sailfishos. The only closed source parts is the gui and in very small amount because all libraries surrounding it are opensource. It's quite difficult to come across something closed source.\n\nNow I said \"biggest alternative to android/IOS to date\", this is true. People who have been in this space for as long as I've been know that. SailfishOS is the oldest one, and has the most amount of apps, AND they're most polished. Second place on the podium would've been taken by ubuntu touch, as its also using libhybris and it has many apps but ecosystem is not as great as SailfishOS. Then is the rest of small fries but pmos as a project to port mainline kernel would probably take a third spot. But libhybris is way faster and way easier to achieve compatibility.\n\nSo ye, if you read all that, thanks, now AMA. I'll be here all day (+- next 12h)",

And I decided to switch to it only because I was given permission to work on a project using my personal laptop (because office laptop had some technical issues and I wasn't going to get one for a month) and I didn't wanted to take risk so I installed Ubuntu as the Stack we use is well supported on Ubuntu only.\n\nAnd damn I was so wrong about Ubuntu! Everything just worked out of the box. No driver issues, every packege I can imagine is available in the repos and all of them work seemlessly. I found Snaps to be better than Flatpaks because Apps like Android Studio and VS Code didn't work out of the box as Flatpaks (because of absurd sandboxing) but I faced no issues at all with Snaps. I also found that Ubuntu is much smoother and much more polished than any distro I have used till now. \n\nI really love the Ubuntu experience so far, and I don't understand the community's irrational hate towards it.",

    "title": "Why Linux has a scattered file system: a deep dive",
    "body": "I've seen a lot of Windows users who have given Linux a shot be confused, annoyed or generally critical of the fact that Windows has a scattered file system where a package will generally install stuff \"all over the place\" instead of in a simple neat directory. Ideally, programs install their static files: .exe's, .dll's and resources; in `C:\\Program Files` , user files in `%APPDATA%` and some small global config in the registry. It's a little more complicated in practice, but that's generally the gist of it. This system does have some advantages. It makes it really easy for a particular program to be installed on a different drive for example. So it does make sense why Windows users would be taken aback by the scattered file system of Linux, where programs have files seemingly all over the place.\n\nAnd so I wanted to make this post to outline what all of the directories in the Linux file system are, why they exist, and what advantages this design has over \"one program &lt;-&gt; one package\" design. It should hopefully also serve as an overview for new Linux users looking to learn more about their system. At least, it will be a post I can link to others if I ever need it.\n\n**Chapter I -- what's in** `/`\n\n**Chapter Ia -- system file directories**\n\nThese are directories where system files live.\n\nIn the traditional Linux view, the \"system\" basically means \"your package manager\". So this includes the core system components and programs installed through your package manager (be it apt on Debian/Ubuntu, dnf on RHEL/Fedora or pacman on Arch). There is no difference real between \"system files\" and \"program files\" on Linux when the programs are installed as packages. The \"base\" system, the one you get right after install, is just a bunch of packages, with many \"spins\" (Fedora KDE, Xubuntu etc.) basically being just different sets of packages to install as base.\n\nUsers do not generally do not write files here, but they read or execute them all the time -- programs, fonts, etc.\n\nThe directories are:\n\n* `/usr` \\-- static files (binaries, libraries, resources, fonts, etc.)\n* `/var` \\-- dynamic files (logs, databases, etc.)\n* `/etc` \\-- configuration files\n* `/boot` \\-- boot files\n\nThe reason these are all different directories? Well, you might want to put each of them on different partitions, or only some of them, or have all of them on the same partition, depending on your use case.\n\nFor example, you may want to mount `/usr` and/or `/etc` as read only after configuring your system to harden it. You may want to share `/etc` around multiple systems that should be configured identically. You may want to only backup `/etc` and `/var` since `/usr` and `/boot` can be easily recreated by the package manager.\n\nThese are not only theoretical use cases. The desktop distro I use is a version of Fedora Immutable, in which `/usr` is mounted as read-only, `/var` is mounted as read-write and `/etc` is mounted as an overlay filesystem, allowing me to modify it, but also allowing me to view what changes I made to system configuration and easily revert if needed.\n\n`/boot` is kept separate because it sometimes needs to be separate, but not always. A use case for this (not the only one) is what I use: most of my disk is encrypted, so `/boot` is a separate, unencrypted partition, so the kernel can launch from there and decrypt the rest of my disk after asking me for the password.\n\n**Chapter Ib -- user file directories**\n\nThese are the directories where users can store files and the package manager will not touch (but other system utilities may touch).\n\nThese directories are:\n\n* `/home` \\-- the home directories of users\n* `/root` \\-- the home directory of the root user (the administrator account)\n* `/srv` \\-- files to be served\n\nThese are pretty self-explanatory. `/root` is not a sub-directory of home because it's actually more something between a system directory and a user directory. Package managers will sometimes touch it.\n\nMoreover, if you have a bunch of Linux servers that share user lists and have `/home` mounted on the network (allowing the user to log into any server and see their files), the `/root` home should still be per-server.\n\n`/srv` is just a convenient place to store files, such as those shared via FTP, HTTP, or any other files you need to store that is not just \"a user's files\". It's entirely unstructured. No tools that I know of create directories here without being told to, so it's a nice place to just put stuff on a server. Not very useful on a desktop.\n\n**Chapter Ic -- temporary mount points**\n\nThese are mostly empty directories (or directories of empty directories) made for mounting partitions, removable drives, .ios's etc. that would not make sense anywhere else in a filesystem -- usually temporarily\n\nThese directories are:\n\n* `/mnt` \\-- for manual mounting\n* `/media` \\-- for automatic mounting of removable media\n\nYou generally do not need to worry about `/mnt` unless you are doing some command line work. Same for `/media`, if you just insert a USB stick, it'll be mounted here, but you'll also get a GUI icon to click on that will take you here, you don't generally have to manually navigate here.\n\n**Chapter Id -- virtual file systems**\n\nThese are directories who's contents don't \"actually exist\" (on disk). One of Linux's great strengths, especially from a developer perspective, is that everything is a file, be it a real one on disk, or a virtual one. Programs that can write to a file, can also write to virtual files, be they disks, terminal windows or device control files.\n\nThese directories are:\n\n* `/run` and `/tmp` \\-- temporary files stored in RAM\n* `/proc` and `/sys` \\-- low level process and system information respectively\n* `/dev` \\-- device files\n\nNow, you can safely ignore `/proc` and `/sys` as a regular user. When you open the GUI ~~Task Manager~~ System Monitor, the GUI System Monitor will read from these places, but you don't need to do so manually.\n\nThe `/run` and `/tmp` files are in-RAM places for temporary files. The reason there are two is historical and I won't go into it.\n\n`/dev` is where all of the devices are represented. You will be exposed to this when you, for example, flash a USB stick, and the flashing utility will allow you to select `/dev/sdb` (SATA drive B) to flash to. Hopefully, you will also get a user-friendly name (\"Kingston DataTraveller 32GB) next to it.\n\n**Chapter Ie -- the** `/opt` **directory**\n\nThere are some cases where programs do want to be installed in a Program Files manner with a huge directory of stuff. This is either stuff that was lazily ported, or stuff with a lot of data (100GB Vivado installs). \n\nThis is what the `/opt` directory is for.\n\nThe package manager will generally not touch it, but graphical installers of proprietary software may default to this place.\n\nIn the case of large installs, it also makes it easier to put some of the sub-directories of `/opt`, or the entire thing, on a separate drive/partition. It also allows large installs to be networked mounted, in the case of many small computers using proprietary software from a local NFS server.\n\n**Chapter II -- the structure of** `/usr`\n\n**Chapter IIa -- the useful sub-directories of** `/usr` **that will always be there**\n\nThese directories are:\n\n* `/usr/bin` \\-- executable meant to be run by users\n* `/usr/lib` \\-- shared libraries (dll's) (see bellow)\n* `/usr/share` \\-- non-executable resource files\n\nThe reason libraries are all together is that each binary is generally dynamically linked, so if the same library is used by 10 different executables, it exists only once in the system.\n\nThe reason binaries are all together is so that the shell can search in one place for all of them.\n\n**Chapter IIb -- the less useful or situational sub-directories of** `/usr` **that will usually always be there**\n\nThese directories are:\n\n* `/usr/src` \\-- sources for packages on the system, generally installed by special `*-src` packages, usually empty or almost empty\n* `/usr/include` \\-- stuff for C programming. Should arguably be a sub-directory to `/usr/share`, but hey, C is the big daddy and gets special privileges\n* `/usr/games` \\-- name is self explanatory. No, this directory is not used today. It's a relic.\n\n**Chapter IIc -- the** `/usr/lib` **debacle**\n\n`/usr/lib` is meant to hold shared libraries (32-bit and 64-bit if multilib is supported) and also \"executable resources\" of packages. The major distros do not agree on where to put each of these things.\n\nOn Debian/Ubuntu we have:\n\n* `/usr/lib/&lt;package&gt;` \\-- executable resources not meant to be run directly by users\n* `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` \\-- 64-bit libraries\n* `/usr/lib/i686-linunx-gnu` \\-- 32-bit libraries\n\nOn Red Hat/Fedora we have:\n\n* `/usr/lib` \\-- 32-bit libraries\n* `/usr/lib64` \\-- 64-bit libraries\n* `/usr/libexec` \\-- executable resources not meant to be run directly by users\n\nOn Arch we have:\n\n* `/usr/lib` \\-- 64-bit libraries\n* `/usr/lib32` \\-- 32-bit libraries\n* `/usr/libexec` \\-- executable resources not meant to be run directly by users\n\n**Chapter IId -- the** `/usr/sbin` **debacle**\n\n`/usr/sbin` is a directory meant for binaries that are not meant to be run by users, but only by administrators and such. It's kind of a relic of the past, and Fedora has moved to replace `/usr/sbin` with a link to `/usr/bin` (it's that way on my system)\n\n**Chapter IIe -- the** `/bin`/`/lib` **debacle**\n\nBack in the olden days, there used to be a difference between the core system that lived on `/` and the fat system that lived on `/usr`. This is a relic of the past. For backwards compatibility, the following links exist:\n\n* `/bin -&gt; /usr/bin`\n* `/sbin -&gt; /usr/sbin`\n* `/lib -&gt; /usr/lib`\n* `/libexec -&gt; /usr/libexec` (on Red Hat/Fedora and Arch)\n* `/lib64 -&gt; /usr/lib64` (on Red Hat/Fedora)\n* `/lib32 -&gt; /usr/lib32` (on Arch)\n\n**Chapter IIf --** `/usr/local`\n\nA copy of all the directories described above exist under `/usr/local` (eg. `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/local/lib`). This exists for packages that maintain the standard bin, lib, share structure, so would not fit in /opt. but are installed by the admin user manually and not through the package manager.\n\nThis is to avoid conflicts and unwanted overwrites. Most source packages (eg. what you find on GitHub) default to installing here after compilation.\n\n**Chapter III -- the structure of** `~`\n\n**Chapter IIIa -- the wild wild** `.west`\n\nPrograms need to store per-user data and they will generally do this in the user's home. This is `/home/bob`, `$HOME` or just `~`.\n\nNow, back in the olden days they did this with no real structure. In Linux, directories that start with a dot are \"hidden\", so they would just throw some directory in the home and store everything there: `~/.vim`, `~/.steam`, `~/.ssh`, etc.\n\n**Chapter IIIb -- the XDG directory system**\n\nRecently, an effort has been made to standardize the places programs put user files. This system mirrors the system hierarchy, but uses more modern naming for things.\n\n* `~/.local/share` \\-- equivalent to `/usr/share`\n* `~/.local/state` \\-- partially equivalent to `/var`; for program state\n* `~/.local/bin` \\-- equivalent to `/usr/bin`\n* `~/.config` \\-- equivalent to `/etc`\n* `~/.cache` \\-- partially equivalent to `/var`; for temporary files too big to store in RAM\n* `/run/user/&lt;uid&gt;` \\-- in RAM temporary files\n\nMore details [here](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/).\n\n**Chapter IIIc -- flatpaks**\n\nFlatpaks are containerized desktop apps. Flatpak stores it's data in `~/.var`",

Chrome for a long time didn't care about giving multi architecture support. Firefox officially supports ARM64 Linux but Chrome only supports x64. You've to rely on unofficial chrome or chromium builds for ARM support.\n\nThe decision to support Chromium based browsers is suspicious because the timing matches with the anti-trust case.\n",

Install **Heroic** (also in your store) and you’re set.\n* Retro gaming? You’ve got emulators for pretty much anything - PS1, PS2, PS3, GameCube, SNES, Xbox, you name it - all right there in your distro's store.\n* Steam Deck, SteamOS.\n* DXVK, VKD3D, Vulkan and Proton are improving all the time.\n* And also tools like MangoHud for hardware info.\n* There are even distros made just for gaming, like **Bazzite**.\n\nEven some big tech influencers are making videos about Linux gaming now. So Basically… gaming on Linux in 2025 is awesome. And I just love how good it has become.\n\n**EDIT:** Some people here are misunderstanding the point of this post. It’s meant to be a celebration of what Linux is right now as a gaming platform - and it’s actually a very good one. At no point am I saying it’s better than Windows or making any direct comparisons.

    "body": "Twenty years ago, when my friends who were serious about coding all switched to linux, I resisted. I want to play my video games in the same OS where I code, I said. In college, while learning to code, I still resisted, not learning bash, sticking to my guns.\n\nFor the last decade, working my fancy corporate data job, I resisted. \"My IDEs work, and our linux dev laptops are too annoying anyway\" I said. At home, I said \"I want to play my video games with no problems more than I want to get rid of everything terrible about windows\"\n\nAnd so my windows setup has grown, with one customization app after another. Synergy, to share mouse and keyboard among my various computers/monitors. DisplayFusion, to wrest some vestige of control from the tyranny of explorer and its awful edge-pushing, heavy handed, \"your grandma should be able to use this\" oriented approach to UI. Endless struggles trying to implement custom keyboard shortcuts for everything I want.\n\nHell no, these last few months as I semi-retired and started coding as a full time hobby, it became too much. I dipped my toe with a distro that looked and acted like windows, then said \"why don't I just set it up like I really want?\". And now I can't stop scrolling through r/unixporn.\n\nI'm sure in no time, I will have my desktop environment setup and be entirely satisfied with it, just like all of you guys.\n\nRight?\n\n...Right?\n\n—edit:\n\nThank you guys, I have read all of the comments, learned some new things, replied to some of you.

    "body": "Hi. \n\nAs you may know, Cisco have banned users from Russia, Belarus, Iran and the occupied Ukrainian territories from accessing their services. What's awkward is that they have a special relationship with the open source implementation of h.264 OpenH264—they distribute the binaries that users would otherwise have to pay for (even to compile!), and quite a lot of projects end up relying on it. \n\nThis leads to a very weird situation. Take, for example, the LocalSend app. It relies on the GNOME runtime. The GNOME runtime needs OpenH264. Flatpak tries fetching the binary for it from Cisco, but they respond with 403. \n\nThis means that for anybody in those territories (or really GeoIP'd as those territories), you essentially CANNOT use any Flatpak that relies on GNOME without a VPN. There's no mirroring, there are no attempts to mitigate this, Flatpak just *is* broken.\n\nSure, you might say that there are some weird ways by which you may block the OpenH264 from being downloaded, but who's to say that dependency management won't get stricter in the future. Sure, currently these sorts of problems are limited to a few places, but they very well could be expanded anywhere the US desires, or Cisco's servers could just die for no reason and break Flatpak with them. \n\nSo here I wonder, is there anything that could be done here? Could Flathub at least mirror the binaries? Or is there a policy of simply not caring if something breaks because of a hidden crutch? \n\nPS: This also extends to Fedora which fetches OpenH264 from Cisco's repo in much the same way. ",

    "body": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'd like to share an open-source project I've been working on called **TmuxAI**.\n\nThere are quite a few great CLI AI tools out there already. So, why build another one? My goal with TmuxAI was to create something that feels more like a human collaborator sitting next to you, specifically within the `tmux` environment you already use.\n\n**The Core Idea: Human-Inspired Observation**\n\nInstead of requiring you to pipe output, start a special subshell, or replace your terminal, TmuxAI takes a different approach:\n\n1. **It Observes:** TmuxAI reads the visible content across your panes in the current tmux window. It sees what you see.\n2. **It Understands Context:** Based on what it observes, it tries to understand what you're doing, just like a colleague looking over your shoulder.\n3. **It Interacts:** You chat with it in a dedicated pane, and it can execute commands (with your permission) in another pane.\n\n**Why is this different?**\n\nThis \"observation\" approach means TmuxAI can potentially assist you without interrupting your existing session or workflow.\n\n* **No need to leave your current task:** Are you deep in a mysql shell, debugging on a remote server via ssh, or configuring network equipment through its specific CLI? TmuxAI can still see the text in that pane and offer help based on it, because it's just reading the screen content. You don't have to exit your interactive session to ask the AI about it.\n* **Works with your existing tools:** It doesn't force you into a specific wrapper or environment. You keep using your preferred shells, editors, and tools within tmux.\n\nThink of it less as a command-line utility you call explicitly for one-off tasks, and more as an assistant that lives alongside you in your tmux window, aware of the broader context visible across your panes.\n\nIt has features like different modes (Observe, Prepare, Watch) and context management, but the core philosophy is this non-intrusive, observational assistance.\n\n**Links**\n\n* **GitHub (Code, Full README, Installation, Issues):** [https://github.com/alvinunreal/tmuxai](https://github.com/alvinunreal/tmuxai)\n* **Website (Screenshots etc):** [https://tmuxai.dev](https://tmuxai.dev/)\n\nIt's still evolving, and I'd be really grateful for any feedback from fellow tmux users. Does this approach resonate? Do you see potential use cases or have suggestions?\n\nThanks for checking it out!",

    "body": "Recently, just before Christmas, I decided to check out Linux again (tried it ~20 years ago) because Windows 11 was about to cause an aneurysm.\n\nI was expecting to spend the \"weekend\" getting everything to work; find hardware drivers, installing various open source software and generally just 'hack together something that works'.\n\nTo my surprise everything worked flawlessly first time booting up. I had WiFi, sound, usb, webcam, memory card reader, correct screen resolution. I even got battery status and management! It even came with a nice litte 'app center' making installation of a bunch of software as simple as a click!\n\nAnd I remember thinking any Windows user could _easily_ install Linux and would get comfortable using it in an afternoon.\n\nI'm pretty 'comfortable' in anything PC and have changed boot orders and created bootable things since the early 90's and considered that part of the installation the easiest part.\n\nHowever, most people have never heard about any of them, and that makes the two steps seem 'impossible'.\n\nI recently convinced a friend of mine, who also couldn't stand Window11, to install Linux instead as it would easily cover all his PC needs. \n\nAnd while he is definitely in the upper half of people in terms of 'tech savvyness', both those \"two easy first steps\" made it virtually impossible for him to install it. \n\nHe easily managed downloading the .iso, but turning that iso into a bootable USB-stick turned out to be too difficult. But after guiding him over the phone he was able to create it.\n\nBut he wasn't able to get into bios despite all my attempts explaining what button to push and when\n\nNext day he came over with his laptop. And just out of reflex I just started smashing the F2 key (or whatever it was) repeatingly and got right into bios where I enabled USB boot and put it at the top at the sequence.\n\nAfter that he managed to install Linux just fine without my supervision.\n\nBut it made me realise that the two first steps in installing Linux, that are second nature to me and probably everyone involved with Linux from people just using it to people working on huge distributions, makes them virtually impossible for most people to install it.\n\nI don't know enough about programming to know of this is possible:\n\nInstead of an .iso file for download some sort of .exe file can be downloaded that is able to create a bootable USB-stick and change the boot order?\n\nThat would 'open up' Linux to _significantly_ more people, probably orders of magnitude..",

The lie is that it's a driver problem. That Linux just doesn't support the fake RAID mode that they forced the storage into when they deliberately sabotaged the BIOS by writing new code to hide AHCI mode and also code to reset the BIOS to their fake RAID mode if the user used EFI Shell to try setting it to AHCI. Let me make my position clear, that Lenovo is lying through their teeth just like they did with Superfish malware incident. They lied until they couldn't lie anymore. Linux should not have to support the RAID mode because the mode should be able to be changed to AHCI, which is fully compatible with Linux, by the user in about 20 seconds. \n\nIf, by some chance, some Very Smart People ever figure out a way to make the SSD visible again, I would STRONGLY advise never upgrading the laptop's firmware again, lest Microsoft and Lenovo find something else to break and then tell us \"Oops. Better run Windows 10 so you can use our 360 degree hinge! Have we told you about our 360 hinge?\".\n\nI believe that if Linux ever gains driver support for the forced fake RAID configuration, that future laptops from Lenovo will just toggle something else so Linux doesn't work on them for a while.\n\nI would strongly advise avoiding the Yoga 910 and Yoga Book when they come out until we find out whether they broke those models as well.\n\nEven if your intent is to never run Linux, Lenovo is the first PC maker I've seen that ships computers that you can't even realistically (for the average user) reinstall Windows on. I will _never_ buy another Lenovo computer again and I will advise others to avoid them whenever the chance arises. I had to spend about an hour googling random support topics before I found a recommendation to use Universal Extractor to get their Windows storage driver to use in a Windows installation thumb drive. Then I had to find a beta version of Universal Extractor that supported the archive format in the setup program just to dig the Intel RST driver out of their godawful installer so that I can slipstream it into a Windows installer.\n\nMost people will have to pay to ship it back to Lenovo if Windows needs to be reinstalled, and will be unable to use the computer for weeks, and it'll probably have some sensitive, confidential, work-related information on the SSD that someone at Lenovo could copy and steal while it's in their repair center.\n\nTheir arrogant forum moderator \"Andy_Lenovo\" posted Lenovo's ridiculous press release to their forum and then marked it as solved. The only part of it that is true is that Linux will likely never be able to install on Yoga laptops, because they are \"designed for Windows 10\", which in my experience has been unstable and full of bugs (like updates stalling out requiring manual installation from offline packages, telling me to reboot everytime I pair my bluetooth headphones, etc.). Unfortunately, in addition to Lenovo and Microsoft's lies, Matthew Garrett wrote some more horsefeathers when he blamed Linux for not supporting a storage mode that shouldn't even be in use anyway. He apparently has a long record of apologizing for Microsoft and misleading people, and it's a shame that he's in the FSF. Of course, the FSF has put some other people in high places that have proceeded to undermine their mission in the past, like Miguel de Icaza.\n\nMaybe it's true that you need \"special drivers\" to make Windows run, but Microsoft doesn't care. It breaks Linux on Lenovo laptops and then makes it look like the problem is in Linux, when it's actually in Microsoft's storage driver and Microsoft is undoubtedly leaning on Intel to keep the way the RST driver does power management a secret.\n\nTo make sure that you don't accidentally buy a Signature Edition computer, on the demo model, click the start (Windows logo) button, click \"about your PC\", and under Windows 10 it will say \"Signature Edition\" if it's part of this program. Also, if you do buy a laptop to see if Linux supports it, then make sure you try installing Linux before the return period expires. If the Linux installer in Live mode can't see your SSD, stop. Unplug the thumb drive, turn the computer off, and I would recommend that you return it. Just tell the store that you decided that you didn't need it or something. It's true.. Nobody needs this kind of aggravation.\n\nEND of my response to Lenovo and Microsoft.\n\n(You do not need to ask for my permission to repost this response in its entirety anywhere else, in hard copy, or on a website.)\n\n----\n\n\n\nI got a reply from Lenovo on my Best Buy review about why the BIOS on my Yoga 900 ISK2 UltraBook has been set to stop people from using Linux.\n\n---\nLenovo Product Expert\nSeptember 20, 2016\nThis system has a Signature Edition of Windows 10 Home installed. It is locked per our agreement with Microsoft.\n---\n\nThis is related to the discussion going on Lenovo's forum's about why the SSD is locked in a proprietary RAID mode that Linux doesn't understand. Laptops known to be affected include the Yoga 900 ISK2, Yoga 900S, and Yoga 710S, which all have the same issue according to posts I've read on Lenovo's Linux forum. I was also told in a PM that the 13ISK for Business has the same issue.\n\nhttps://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206 - The forum thread for the Yoga 900 ISK2 -UPDATE - The forum thread on Lenovo's website is back up. It was deleted for a while, but now they've re-posted it in a locked state. *sigh*\n\nHere is Google's cache of the forum in case it disappears again: https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:abMCb7w2uAoJ:https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=za\n\nI'm told that CataclysmZA is backing this up in the Wayback Machine. I want to thank them for this, since this is probably Lenovo's attempt at a late night shredding party before the news can pick up the story. (Update: Posted at the bottom.\n\nUpdate: The Lenovo employee posted about locking the thread. Basically, he called me disruptive and then said that if they had to, they would turn on pre-approval so that nobody can comment anywhere on their support forum until they've read it and have made sure it won't embarrass them. Nice, huh? Don't address the issue. Don't say anything about whether the problem will be fixed. Don't re-open the thread. Just threaten and bully people with the \"We can make sure your posts are never seen.\" option.\n\nhttps://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Installing-Ubuntu-16-04-on-Yoga-900S/td-p/3336715 - The thread for the problems with the 900S.\n\nhttps://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/710S-Can-t-install-Linux-on-Ideapad-710S-how-do-you-disable-RAID/td-p/3432553 - The thread for the problem with the 710S.\n\nWill the Yoga Book and the Yoga 910 have these problems? We don't know because they are not released yet, but we should know soon.\n\nI've attached a screenshot of my review for the 900 ISK2 and Lenovo's reply.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/niewu\n\nSo they admitted that this is now a requirement for Signature PCs. \n\nSo be warned that if you buy a \"Microsoft Signature PC\", it may not be allowed to run Linux, per Microsoft.\n\nThe Yoga 900 ISK2 at Best Buy is not labeled as a Signature Edition PC, but apparently it is one, and Lenovo's agreement with Microsoft includes making sure Linux can't be installed.\n\n----\n\nUPDATE: I've sent emails out to several members of the media trying to shine some light on what Lenovo is up to. If anyone could help me ping some reporters I'd sure appreciate the help. So far I've contacted Adrian Kinglsey-Hughes, Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols, Michael Larabel of Phoronix, and Dr. Roy Schestowitz of Techrights. We've been discussing the issue on the Techrights IRC channel on Freenode, so Techrights might have something about this posted soon\n\n----\nI just commented for someone who is writing an article who asked me to speak. Here's part of what I said...\n\n\"I think that Lenovo's official reply is insufficient and carefully worded. They talk about how much they love to support Linux and then say that they don't support Linux on many of their own laptops. Actions speak louder than words, and there's no technical reason other than the BIOS RAID mode lock why the Yoga 900 ISK2 and other affected systems wouldn't be great Linux machines. I also think that locking down the thread and editing peoples comments and then blaming forum posters for being \"disruptive\" was uncalled for, and they're obviously trying to turn this around and make it seem like I am overreacting or somehow I'm at fault for what they did. And unfortunately, some of the media reports have taken up this narrative instead of looking into why Lenovo would do such things to their computers. There is no REAL issue with Linux not supporting these laptops other than the one Lenovo created. They need to make a BIOS patch that users can install, like other Ultrabook PC makers did, not more excuses.\"\n\n\"I think that [the BIOS RAID lock] was a deliberate design choice made by Lenovo, and I say that because the BIOS code that they use has AHCI mode available for the storage device, which Linux and Windows understand without any special drivers. Lenovo patched the code to remove the AHCI mode from the BIOS setup utility and then they wrote additional code to make sure that you can't set AHCI mode with an EFI variable using EFI shell. So, I'd say it's definitely deliberate, and can't see any LEGITIMATE reason why they would have. It isn't really faster, it makes recovering Windows from Microsoft's installer very difficult if you have to later. About the only thing putting a single SSD setup into RAID mode using the BIOS gives you is (a) Linux won't be able to use the storage and (b) greater potential for data loss.\"\n\n\"I think that Microsoft and Lenovo agreed to lock Linux out, and forcing RAID mode accomplishes that. In the last 11 months, nobody except one Lenovo forum poster that used a modded BIOS and an external flasher to get around Lenovo's signature check on BIOS updates has managed to install Linux on the Yoga models affected by this. I believe that Lenovo and Microsoft figured that if Linux ever did get driver support for this configuration, that it would be years after the product was released, so it might as well be forever. Most people replace their laptop every 5 years or less, so almost nobody would ever be able to run Linux on the Yoga laptops while in their designed service life.\"\n\nEdit: If anyone has anymore problems with Lenovo deleting the thread, here's the Wayback Machine version.\n\nPage 1 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921064057/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206\nPage 2 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921064404/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/2\nPage 3 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921064603/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/3\nPage 4 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921064734/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/4\nPage 5 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921064900/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/5\nPage 6 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921064949/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/6\nPage 7 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921065152/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/7\nPage 8 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921065333/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/8\nPage 9 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921065450/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/9\nPage 10 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921065541/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/10\nPage 11 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921065644/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/11\nPage 12 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921065754/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/12\nPage 13 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921070115/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/13\nPage 14 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921070321/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/14\nPage 15 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921070440/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/15\nPage 16 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921070608/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/16\nPage 17 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921070806/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/17\nPage 18 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921070912/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/18\nPage 19 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921071051/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/19",

    "body": "In AMD’s AMA [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/5x4hxu/we_are_amd_creators_of_athlon_radeon_and_other/), they say they will seriously consider releasing their Platform Security Processor (PSP) source code. This is their equivalent of the Intel Management Engine and would make AMD processors compatible with coreboot/libreboot.\n\nThis would be massive. It would make it possible to have a truly open-source machine, with all the security and privacy benefits that entails. At the moment secure boot relies primarily on aging Intel processors from nearly a decade ago.\n\nIn 2011, AMD began supporting coreboot, but stopped in 2013 and introduced the PSP. Why? Because they didn’t think it was economically worthwhile.\n\n**Don’t let that happen again!** Let’s tell AMD there is demand for this. Get into that thread and comment. And – more importantly – message them! If you’re reading this after the AMA has ended, contact them anyway!\n\n[AMD’s Twitter](https://twitter.com/amd?lang=en)\n\n[AMD’s Forums](https://community.amd.com/places?filterID=all~objecttype~space)\n\n[AMD’s contact page](https://www.amd.com/en-us/who-we-are/contact) (You can find details on AMD in your country) \n\nYou can also reach them on Facebook.\n\nEDIT: Some people are saying they want to call. I think that's great - do it! The best number I have found (so far) for North America is (877) 284-1566. Customer service, but they're able to take and pass on feedback at least. If anyone has other country numbers or a better one for North America, let me know and I can add them.\n\nEDIT 2: It’s working! This has ‘CEO level attention’.

    "body": "OK everyone, update to my last post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/5x5xl3/amd_to_consider_corebootlibreboot_support_contact/) about the possibility of AMD open sourcing/releasing the PSP (Platform Security Processor) which could allow Coreboot/Libreboot support. Back in the [original AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/5x4hxu/we_are_amd_creators_of_athlon_radeon_and_other/), u/AMD_james (Product Manager in CPU Business Development) commented on this again in the last 2 hours. [Full comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/5x4hxu/we_are_amd_creators_of_athlon_radeon_and_other/dekwva9/?context=3): \n\n\n&gt;Thanks for the feedback. Please believe me that this has CEO level attention and AMD is investigating the steps and resources necessary to support this. It is not the work of a minute, so please bear with us as we define what we can do. \n\n\nJust to reiterate, this is **so important** for free, secure and open source computing. And enough people contacted AMD that they took notice. No actual change yet – but let’s keep letting them know how much we want it, and that it could be a major boost for AMD too.\n\n\nSo, in the next few days/weeks/months - **keep contacting AMD**! Don’t let them forget and don’t let the FOSS and security communities forget. This is a huge opportunity and one that might not come again.\n\n\nu/AMD_james is of course right that this will take a little time. So as we wait, don’t get mad that an open source PSP isn’t here yet. Instead, let’s just keep making it clear that we are grateful that they are looking into this and that if/when it does arrive, they will have a *lot* of dedicated customers and supporters.\n\n\nContact details below, again:\n\n\n[AMD’s Twitter](https://twitter.com/amd?lang=en)\n\n[AMD’s Forums](https://community.amd.com/places?filterID=all~objecttype~space)\n\n[AMD’s contact page](https://www.amd.com/en-us/who-we-are/contact) (You can find details on AMD in your country) \n\nBest number for North America: (877) 284-1566\n\nYou can also reach them on Facebook.\n\nEDIT: One other possibility – contact any media outlets you think might be interested.

Here’s the breakdown:\n\n1. **Endless forms** with useless questions that took **10+ hours** to complete.\n2. **IQ-style test** (for some reason).\n3. **Language test**—seriously, why?\n\nAfter passing those, I moved to the interview stages:\n\n1. **Technical interview** – Python coding.\n2. **Manager interview** – Career discussions (with the hiring team).\n3. **Another tech interview** – System architecture and general tech questions.\n4. **HR interview** – Career-related topics, but HR had no clue about salary expectations.\n5. **Another manager interview** (not in the hiring team).\n6. **Hiring lead interview** – Positive feedback.\n7. **VP interview** – **Very positive feedback**, I was literally told, *\"You tick all the boxes for this position.\"*\n\nEventually, I **received an offer**. Since I was already employed, I resigned to start in four weeks. Even though the salary—revealed **only after four months**—was underwhelming, it was a bit higher than my previous job, so I accepted. The emotional toll of the long process made me push forward.\n\n# And then, the disaster…\n\nOne week after accepting the offer, I woke up to an email from the hiring manager stating that, after further discussions with upper management, they had decided to cancel my application.\n\nWhat upper management? No one ever mentioned this step. And why did this happen after I received an offer?\n\nI sent a few polite and respectful emails asking for an explanation. No response. Neither from my hiring manager nor HR.\n\nNow, I’m left starting from scratch (if not worse), struggling to pay my bills.\n\n# My advice if you’re considering Canonical:\n\n* Prepare emotionally for a very long process.\n* Expect childish behavior like this.\n* Never resign until you’ve actually started working.\n\nI would never recommend Canonical to anyone I care about. If you're considering applying, I highly recommend checking Reddit and Glassdoor for feedback on their hiring process to make your own judgment.\n\nP.S. :\n\n\\- If your company is recruiting in europe, and you can share that info or refer me. please do !",

Recently he got an expensive Lenovo and has dove headfirst into this Linux stuff. \n\nHe tries to explain it to me. I don’t know what he’s saying! “Ubuntu,” “Free and Open,” “terminal.” He’s got this new software that’s not google called “Brave.” He got a Raspeberry Pie thing for Christmas. He’s so enamored with it, and wants to share it with me and make me use it, but he can’t explain it to me well enough for me to understand and when looking it up myself I can’t find many basic user friendly explanations either. Frankly, I’m a little scared of computers. Terrified of getting hacked. Anything wonky looking on my computer scares me and sometimes Linux looks, well, creepy to me. It’s definitely my lack of knowledge. I am a complete noob. \n\nIf you guys had a friend, or gf, who knew nothing about Linux or ANYTHING, how would you even begin to explain it? I want to understand the slightest bit so I don’t crush his excitement with my lack of personal understanding (editing because the first way I worded it got the point across wrong)\n\nEdit:\n\nThank you guys! I can’t believe how this blew up. I have been reading through all of the comments and a majority of them have been kind and very helpful. :) There’s a stigma around nerds especially computer nerds sometimes and I was a little nervous to come on here but you guys really wowed me that you guys really just care about this stuff and want to help. I wanted to address some things I’ve gotten comments on:\n\nA lot of relationship advice. My boyfriend and I have talked about what the line is between sharing our stuff and being too melded together. He’s shown me many interests that I happen to have found I liked and vice versa. I’ve actually been pursuing some new interests recently such as cross stitch that can be my own thing apart from us. We very much enjoy each other and communicate often. Some of you are telling me not to feign interest and I’ll be honest, even if I don’t dive into this fully I just would like to know what he’s talking about to support him. \n\nEdited again because the passage I just wrote here didn’t make sense thank you guys again!!",

This guy's been through some serious shit.. some people may remember me running Windows 11 on it. Some might remember running Arch virtual machine without hardware acceleration inside of windows 11 and then running DOOM on it. But now as a Linux guy i decided that Arch is the was on this boy so I did it. Process is pretty straightforward and easy to anyone who has ever installed Arch and messed with Android phones internals. I got it working in a couple of hours. \nWhat works:\n        *Wifi/Bluetooth \n        *Touchscreen,120hz panel\n        *Audio\n        *GPU (Adreno 640) and CPU, obviously \n        *Dualboot with Android system \n        *USB for data transfer \nWhat does not:\n        *Charging (weird, may fix in the future)\n\nWell, I haven't done much with it yet bc I've just finished everything but I'm definitely going to make touchscreen work properly in Hyprland, maybe install some benchmarks and compare it with my surface laptop 4 haha. Anyway, if you have any questions I'm glad to answer them",

    "body": "*Brussels — April 1, 2025*\n\n\n\nIn a move that’s shaking up the tech world and raising eyebrows in Silicon Valley, the Belgian government has announced a groundbreaking new tariff: a **“Freedom Fee”** on all commercial software developed in the United States.\n\n\n\nEffective immediately, the new regulation introduces a 17.76% tax on American-made proprietary software sold or used in Belgium — a number officials insist is “purely symbolic” and definitely not a cheeky nod to US independence.\n\n\n\n“We believe in supporting software that reflects European values: openness, collaboration, and the joy of reading through thousands of lines of undocumented C code,” said Minister of Digital Affairs, Luc Verstegen, in a press conference held entirely via a LibreOffice Impress presentation. “This is not a punishment — it’s an encouragement to embrace open source. Also, Microsoft Excel crashed on us during the budget meetings.”\n\n\n\n**A Loophole for Libre**\n\n\n\nUnder the new policy, open-source software is fully exempt. Government agencies have reportedly already begun transitioning from Adobe products to GIMP and Inkscape, with mixed emotional results.\n\n\n\nPublic schools will phase out commercial learning software in favor of “whatever runs on Linux Mint,” and the Finance Ministry has proudly announced that all future taxes will now be calculated using LibreOffice Calc macros, described by one insider as “a heroic but deeply confusing experience.”\n\n\n\n**US Tech Giants Respond**\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for a major US software company, who asked not to be named (but their name rhymes with “Macrosoft”), warned that this could spark a digital trade war.\n\n\n\n“We support freedom — freedom to license, freedom to upsell, and freedom to crash during updates,” they said in a tersely worded Clippy-shaped press release.\n\n\n\n**FOSS Community Rejoices**\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, open-source developers worldwide are celebrating. GitHub has reported a spike in Belgian forks of previously dormant repos, including a sudden revival of interest in a 2003 Perl-based accounting tool named “MooseBudget.”\n\n\n\nLocal developer communities are planning a national holiday called “Libre Day,” during which Belgians will ceremonially uninstall commercial versions of antivirus software and replace them with open-source alternatives. Whether it’s a bold stand for digital sovereignty or just an elaborate April Fools’ prank with exceptional patch notes, one thing is clear: Belgium has officially ctrl-alt-deleted business as usual.\n\n\\#AprilFools #DigitalSovereignty #OpenSource #TechPolicy #GovTech #SoftwareTax #Innovation #MadeInBelgium #FOSS #DigitalTransformation #CyberHumor #LinkedInHumor #EUtech \n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaspernuyens\\_aprilfools-digitalsovereignty-opensource-activity-7312789588660355072-rohB/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=member\\_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAACO1wBefRMas4ftt\\_uS1IGBYyC\\_ziPY5k](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaspernuyens_aprilfools-digitalsovereignty-opensource-activity-7312789588660355072-rohB/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAACO1wBefRMas4ftt_uS1IGBYyC_ziPY5k)\n\n",

    "body": "Hey r/linux\n\nI wanted to share an exciting weekend project my kids and I tackled: we built a beast of a home server powered by an AMD EPYC 7C13 (3rd gen). This CPU is typically found in big cloud provider datacenters, but we managed to snag one on eBay for just $875 (MSRP is ~$7000)\n\n**Quick Benchmark Highlights:**\n\n- M.2 SSD: Achieves a blazing 7GB/sec throughput.\n- DDR4 RAM: Delivers a jaw-dropping 130GB/sec bandwidth.\n- Linux Kernel Build: Fully compiles with all options enabled in 10 minutes. (This would normally take an hour on a typical setup!)\n\nI actually did a separate post on this in r/homelab with more technical details/prices if you’re curious - https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1hmnnwg/built_a_powerful_and_silent_amd_epyc_home_server/\n\n**Part 2: We Created a Minimalist Linux Distro for It!**\n\nWe also developed and open-sourced a lightweight Linux distribution tailored for this server, called Sbnb Linux. You can check it out here: https://github.com/sbnb-io/sbnb\n\n**Why Sbnb Linux?**\n\nSbnb Linux is designed for simplicity, focusing on booting bare-metal servers and setting up remote connectivity with zero hassle using Tailscale. Even more remarkable, it comes pre-configured for Confidential Computing (AMD SEV-SNP) right out of the box. Learn more at README-CC.\n\n**How It Works:**\n\n- Write the sbnb.raw image to a USB flash drive.\n- Add your Tailscale key as plaintext to the drive.\n- Boot your server from the USB.\n- Within minutes, your server appears in your Tailscale machine list.\n- SSH to your server using Tailscale OAuth (e.g., Google Auth).\n- Bonus: With one Docker command, you can seamlessly switch Sbnb Linux to any other distro (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS, Alpine). See the https://github.com/sbnb-io/sbnb/ for details!\n\nThis combo of high-performance hardware and a minimalist OS has been incredibly satisfying to build.\n\nIf you’ve worked on something similar or have any questions about our setup, I’d be delighted to hear from you!\n\nI also extend a warm welcome to anyone interested in joining this exciting opportunity to develop a new Linux distro focused on confidential computing and resilience!",

    "body": "In a recent update, the Raspberry Pi Foundation installed a Microsoft apt repository on all machines running Raspberry Pi OS (previously known as Raspbian) without the administrator’s knowledge.\n\nOfficially it’s because they endorse Microsoft’s IDE (!), but you’ll get it even if you installed from a light image and use your Pi headless without a GUI. This means that every time you do “apt update” on your Pi you are pinging a Microsoft server.\n\nThey also install Microsoft’s GPG key used to sign packages from that repository. This can potentially lead to a scenario where an update pulls a dependency from Microsoft’s repo and that package would be automatically trusted by the system.\n\nI switched all my Pi’s to vanilla Debian but there are other alternatives too. Check the /etc/apt/sources.list.d and /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d folders of your Pi’s and decide for yourself.\n\n**EDIT:** Some additional information. The vscode.list and microsoft.gpg files are created by a postinstall script for a package called raspberrypi-sys-mods, version 20210125, hosted on the Foundation's repository.\n\nDoing an \"apt show raspberrypi-sys-mods\" lists a GitHub repo as the package's homepage, but the changes weren't published until a few hours ago, almost two weeks after the package was built and hours after people were talking about this issue. Here a comment by a dev admitting the changes weren't pushed to GitHub until today: [https://github.com/RPi-Distro/raspberrypi-sys-mods/issues/41#issuecomment-773220437](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/raspberrypi-sys-mods/issues/41#issuecomment-773220437).\n\nPeople didn't have a chance to know about the new repo until it was already added to their sources, along with a Microsoft GPG key. Not very transparent to say the least. And in my opinion not how things should be done in the open source world. ",

This is because they have been burned by Windows sneaking in undesirable features, reinstalling applications (Edge) that they explicitly uninstalled, and even forcibly updating to Windows 11 from 10. They are justifiably looking to delete something that has, on the surface, harmed them in the past.\n\nBut they do not understand that auto-updates exist for a legitimate reason. Software bug fixes, QOL and Accessibility enhancements, and most critically, patching SECURITY vulnerabilities that must be done *immediately*!! Users should NOT be responsible for being proactive about this stuff, the vendors should! Auto-Updates are Good, Actually. I even allow my Arch to do it!\n\nI, of course, place the blame firmly at Microsoft. Their piggybacking on a security essential to push customer-unfriendly things all out of greed has directly contributed to a paranoia that directly hinders public safety.\n\nBut, open-source is here to repair the harm caused by corporate greed. **How can the Linux community as a whole contribute to lessening this paranoia and restore trust in those that actually work to keep their personal devices safe?**",

    "body": "I'm a relatively recent linux user (about 4 months) after migrating from Windows. I'm running Ubuntu 24.04 on a Lenovo ThinkPad and have had zero issues this whole time. It was easy to set up, I got all the programs I wanted, did some minor cosmetic adjustments, and its been smooth sailing since.\n\nI was just curious why, when I go on these forums and people ask which distro to use when starting people almost never say Ubuntu? It's almost 100% Mint or some Ubuntu variant but never Ubuntu itself. The most common issue I see cited is snaps, but is that it? Like, no one's forcing you to use snaps.\n\nEDIT: Wow! I posted this and went to bed. I thought I would get like 2 responses and woke up to over 200! Thanks for all the answers, I think I have a better picture of what's going on. Clearly people feel very strongly about this!",

Debian.  \n  \nI understand that Distrowatch's ranking != actual popularity, but the question still stands: what makes it so interesting? How come people don't mention it as much in Reddit? ",

    "body": "This is coming back from someone that used Linux for about a year and half as a daily distro and recently switched back to Windows. Don't get me wrong, if I ever get a laptop that isn't a gaming one or build a full AMD PC, I will use Linux, as the possibilities with it are endless and it's kind of fun, but for a lot of people - please, do the research, not only about software, but also hardware.\n\nI'm not going to get into the all the issues I've had, just my personal experience and advice for people looking to switch\n\n* If you use custom game launchers, mod managers or any other custom stuff, try to look for information if it's possible to run it on Linux. Most of the time, they will work, but the chances are, they won't be as easy to set up. \n* If you use some peripherals that rely on some software, look into if there are options to manage it on Linux. But still, keep in mind, that if you use some niche thing, there's a chance you won't be able to properly use it on Linux. And even with some popular brands, there still might be issue. For example, my Logitech G920 steering wheel. It is possible to use it, but the drivers have some weird issues that it's not worth the time to try and fix it compared to the time I actually use the wheel.\n   * Mice - Piper\n   * RGB - OpenRGB, SignalRGB\n   * Steering wheels - Oversteer\n   * And a bunch of others...\n* Here, I might offend some people. Microsoft Office has no competitors. While yes, LibreOffice, OpenOffice and others do exist, Microsoft Office is just, sadly, better. Yes, Office for Web does exist, but it's meh also. But, don't be afraid, there are options to run it on Linux - WinApps, some Windows docker tool (forgot how it's called), virtual machines and I'm guessing in time, there will be other options also.\n* A lot of alternative software also works on Windows. So if you wanna test, for example, the before mentioned LibreOffice, or DaVinci Resolve or GIMP or any other stuff, you can do so on Windows and decide if that software will actually fit your needs. \n* And the last thing and I think it's the most important one, Linux isn't not as easy as most people like to say. If you use it solely as a Steam gaming machine, get some distro like Bazzite and maybe you'll be alright, or just as a video/documents machine you're fine, but if you use it for much more, I'm 90% sure, you will run into some weird issue at some point, that you wouldn't have on Windows and you will need to run a terminal or look through config files to resolve it. The only thing I would suggest, don't rely on AI to try and resolve issues like this. Most of the time it has outdated information or something that actually is not right for your choice of distribution. Linux communities are great, so just ask around and you'll definitely find a solution.\n\n  \nAnd for the end of this, Windows still stucks, ran into the issues the minute I booted into it :) But at the same time, it runs everything I need without a hassle.

    "body": "Why is ext4 recommended over xfs? It seems like after doing a bit of research, xfs is \"better\" in just about every way--more performant in edge cases, arguably just as \"stable\", continues to be highly developed (and from some reading, some claim its codebase is more more developer-friendly and manageable). It is even the default filesystem for some distros. It seems preferred in enterprise solutions, which should suggest it's reliable/performant. In most if not all aspects, it is at least equal if not better.\n\nBut I remember starting Linux and ext4 was the overwhelming recommendation as the best general-purpose filesystem (and I'm considering xfs as general-purpose hence the comparison), so much so that I didn't think xfs was as serious of an alternative.\n\nI believe one real complaint was that xfs was not as resilient when it fails as a result of power/disk failure, but I've come across comments that suggest this has been fixed over time and it is no less prone to such failures compared to filesystems like ext4. It is also more CPU-intensive but I'm not sure if this is actually relevant even in use cases like on a Pi server.\n\nI'm thinking of using xfs for all use cases: external drives, whether HDD or flash storage and for thumb drives and SD cards; for NAS; for backup storage, etc.) unless I need snapshotting capabilities such as for system partitions in which case I would use btrfs which is more featureful at the expense of overhead.\n\nIn doing some research I think exFAT is also of interest as a filesystem for certain applications (definitely not general purpose for Linux use) as a lean filesystem but it seems to be just slightly too barebones (case-insensitivity and relatively shorter filenames so not suitable for backing up files, permission are sometimes useful but exFAT is permission-less). I think exFAT might be ideal for backup drives with software like borg/kopia which does encryption themselves so these don't matter(?).\n\nIs this a decent comparison of the filesystems and what have I overlooked? I'm sure for desktop users perhaps none of these benefits may be felt but _choosing_ a filesystem costs nothing and in that case isn't it better to choose something that appears to be more/better developed and with the assurance of being used in an enterprise setting with no apparent downsides?",

    "body": "I am new to Linux but I am really enjoying learning all there is about Linux's past, and I have noticed a fair share of interesting projects that I am disappointed are now abandoned. Here is one from me:\n\n--\n\n---\n\n[**Project Looking Glass**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Looking_Glass) \n\n&gt;  Looking Glass was first developed by **Hideya Kawahara**, a Sun programmer who wrote it in his spare time on a Linux laptop. After demonstrating an early version to Sun executives, he was assigned to it full-time with a dedicated team and open sourced the project.\n\n*- Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia*\n\n--\n \n\nProject Looking Glass was a WM licensed under the GPL(2.0) that was written in the Java language primarily made for Linux that also aimed to be crossplatform to other *NIX systems and even Windows! It started as a hobby project but was for a time officially supported by Sun Microsystems. Unless I am missing some hobby project there isn't one written in Java that exists anymore, so Java alone would make it interesting but that's just the surface of it.\n\n Unlike all major environments today it was not just 2D with 3D effects, it was FULLY 3D. It used **Java3D** with graphical acceleration to build 3d windows for both existing application programs and ones specifically designed for Looking Glass. So the really interesting part of this WM was the unique ways it leveraged it's 3D nature to adopt completely revolutionary features and solutions to problems for the time and honestly, still to this day.\n\n For example, windows were drawn in 3D, and you could turn them around and draw faces at the back of them, that meant that you could theoretically have two different windows on one single window. And the sides of windows had the names of it's title displayed like books! Seriously, [take a look at how cool it was.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Looking_Glass#/media/File:LG3D-slanted-windows.jpg) - The project has long since been abandoned. It was probably one of the many casualties of the butchering of Sun Microsystems after the 2008 Financial Crisis and it's buyout by [the Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation), it's last update was in 2007. Java 3D isn't officially maintained anymore either, while a fan maintained project exists it's apparently slow moving with updates. However if one of you renegades out there want to take a look at it for inspiration, [the read-only source tree](https://github.com/Ed-Fernando) of the [core](https://github.com/Ed-Fernando/lg3d-core) and other applications that came with it have been mirrored on Github (thanks Ed Fernando!)\n\n--\n\n\nSad fact: After a fun demonstration of it at the 2003 Linux Expo, Apple CEO Steve Jobs personally called up the [CEO of Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_I._Schwartz) and told him point blank that Apple **would sue Sun if they moved forward to commercialize it.** Jobs felt the project infringed Apple's intellectual property. Apparently this decision was not the reason it was dropped, since it received support for years after but I am sure it didn't help. -  Oh, and just to twist the knife Apple would also later do something *suspiciously similar* to Project Looking Glass with their widgets &amp; their dock on Leopard.  😕\n\n\n---\n\n--\n\nSorry for the longish write up, but researching this is what made me interested in more projects like this from Linux's past that haven't been documented for us later Linux users to discover. - What are some unique projects that ***you***  miss from the past? Sentimental or stuff that would still be revolutionary. Both are fine!  \n\nPrevious versions that are starkly different from currently maintained projects too, I suppose!",

I already have it installed on a second drive and I really have no problems using it at all. I'm having a great time and it's rewarding to get to understand the system better.\n\nUnfortunately, my work software does not and will not work on anything but Windows. Like, *famously* so, even. My goal is to have one drive for Linux and one just for Windows so I can use this software. The problem is it's too convenient for me to stay on Windows and not switch over ONLY to use the work software. I've already tried installing a VM on the Linux drive to run the software, but the resource cost for me + the latency was unbearable and I'd prefer to run it on bare metal.\n\nMy next step is to make using Windows as inconvenient as possible by uninstalling all programs that I can use on Linux instead to only use it for work, and I'm hoping it'll piss me off enough to get me to switch over more consistently. I'm just curious to see how y'all have managed to switch over when a program you need is Windows-only. How did you make it stick?",

Since they are only going to use it for home, browsing, YouTube and some online shopping, I only enable the firewall, which is how I have it, now, should I install or implement something else?

    "body": "I've seen a lot of hate towards beginner-friendly distros around the internet. I'm a somewhat newcomer to Linux and I use ZorinOS currently, primarily because it's ready OOTB and it meets my requirements for daily activities (studying, coding, offline gaming). (context: I have 8GB of RAM on my laptop and Spyware 11 took 7GB  just to \"exist\").\n\n  \nI understand that beginner distros are very restraining on the potential of Linux, but I think it is a good thing for the most part. Let me explain:\n\nFrom what i see, beginner-friendly distros are a good way to free everyday users from Spyware 11 and Fuckintosh and expand the lifespan of older PCs. Keeping in mind that apart from Adobe, Solidworks and other industry-required software (that are mostly used by people who have to work with this stuff), and that the majority of PC users only needs a browser, ad doc editor and a spreadsheet for the everyday usage,  wouldn't be useful to have ready to use distros with recognizable interfaces?\n\nAnother thing to consider: these distros can be helpful to make the transition easier for non-tech-savvy people and older generations who are not always willing to learn a new interface from scratch.\n\nWhat's your opinion on the matter? Should we just realize the fact that non everybody wants to spend hours just to set up wifi drivers? Or instead the larger public should start to get into the detail on how linux works?\n\n\nEDIT: ok looking back at the comments I realize a may have previously stumbled in some “hardcore” Linux power users or something like that. I now see that in the broader community there is no real “hate” on beginner friendly distros and instead most people actually recommend these kind of distros to newcomers. (Prolly my viewpoint was also bc I’m graduating in computer engineering, there are a lot of edgelords in my class)\nThanks guys, you’ve shown me the real part of the community, you made me want to come more around here, gg everyone &lt;3",

Don't get me wrong Gnome is good but for me it feels off for some reason.\n\nAfter my adventure with Ubuntu, I used Zorin as I heard it felt more like Windows and it is easy to get in and it was right I learned most my linux stuff in Zorin but I started to feel like Zorin wasn't either as I asked for something light-weight too.\n\nAfter Zorin, Bazzite with KDE came and oh boy...Bazzite might be the longest I stick to a distro for a good while. I used it like a month before saying \"ugh\" due to gtk mouse error keep popping in terminal when something needs to be written and even in latest update when I tried it had the same issue, after that I went back to Windows just to remember why I don't like Windows 11, it uses so much resource and it is not even good to use nor easy to customize so I went on my search for new distro and I met, Fedora.\n\nSo far I think positively about Fedora 42 (KDE Plasma Edition). it is faster, it allows my resources used better and it allows me to do my day to day work fast and efficiently with no error or issues and even then when it has issues it is mostly on me bc I keep looking around and doing things I shouldn't even tho my child like brain tells me to poke things I see. Other than that I like how KDE is, it has it's issues but overall I feel more in home with how customizable it is.\n\nFor now I don't plan to distro hop but if I do, I would change to get Arch with KDE but first I need to learn how to setup Arch.\n\nIf I like a suggestion I will try and yeah see how it is\n\nEDIT: I accidentally nuked my Fedora install when I was installing arch bc I had no space and wanted go make a partition by splitting the fedora's space XD",

Sometimes you only get binaries and have to build everything yourself.  \nUbuntu, on the other hand, is easy to install, most software works immediately, and you generally do not run into many issues, although you get less customization in some areas.\n\nI work with languages like C# and C++, and in my experience Linux is great for development. The problem is that I also play a lot of games, including VR.  \nOn Fedora, I liked how customizable the interface was and how easy it was to set up my development environment, but I had problems with my VR setup and some games. As a side note, I tried to get my Rift CV1 working with Envision, but that did not succeed.\n\nSo my question is: which distro offers the best balance of stability, ease of use, and customization, while still working well for gaming and VR?",

To this day most applications are shipped as a small binary with a list of dependencies. The System clearly causes a lot of issues, hence why we have Flatpack on the Desktop and Docker or LXC on the server to deal with the dependency hell that's destant to unfold because of this design (I know Flatpack and Docker have other features as well, but solving dependency hell  between libraries is still one of the main selling points).\n\nI'm also aware that historically there were many good reasons for going with dynamically linked applications - mostly storage and memory savings, but I'd say these days they don't really apply.

Big takeaway for me is that Linux software is all in singular repos, which may seem obvious to you but as a lifelong Windows user retrieving software from hundreds of random sites, I thought of the Software Manager as a 'basic suite' option rather than the main place I'm meant to install from.\n\nThanks all :)\n\n  \n\\---------------\n\n\n\nSimplest way to describe my perspective is as follows:\n\nI love the concept of open source software - I have great respect for people who develop these systems and those that can make use of them to the fullest extent.\n\nHowever, I am not a power user of any kind. I have been trying out Linux Mint on a secondary laptop for about a year now to see if I can ultimately switch from Windows. The basic functionality is completely fine and the 'out of the box' software does it's job, but in order to set up normal installs for software I am forced to use terminal far more than I would like.\n\nThe software manager is unreliable as it often points to old unmaintained forks and adds their inactive repositories, so I've tried to install most things through terminal/github but this is not what I want out of my operating system. I want to use my computer as a tool and I don't have any interest in learning extensive terminal language just to do so - and it's uncomfortable to use this system when every install guide asks you to use 'sudo' followed by a string I have zero understanding of the function of.\n\nAs an example: today I tried to setup OneDrive (https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive/) and realised that this does not have any GUI. No worries, in the extensive usage notes the dev links to a supported GUI (https://github.com/bpozdena/OneDriveGUI). To set this up I need to clone the github directory. To clone the directory I need a developer PAT (and I don't properly understand how this works). OK, now it's cloned I need to install PySide6 Essentials which seems to be on the official python package index but for some reason will not allow me to install unless it's done inside a virtual environment (which again I do not understand properly). So I install the python3.12-venv, activate the venv and try to run the file and the error I get is \"Could not load the Qt platform plugin \"xcb\" in \"\" even though it was found\". Searching for this i run into this StackOverflow question that looks just exhausting to go through (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59809703/could-not-load-the-qt-platform-plugin-xcb-in-even-though-it-was-found)\n\nTLDR - I find the constant need to troubleshoot and use command line exhausting, I have no bandwidth to learn linux in any meaningful depth, I chose Mint because it was recommended as one of the simplest. Is there a better option? Are automated installers? Should I give up and just use Windows forever? Given that I don't view using my operating system as a hobby, is linux an impractical for basic users?\n\nThanks for reading, I'm impressed by you all who know your way around these systems so well, keen to hear your thoughts.",

Recently, my trainer asked if I was interested in Linux, so I switched to Linux.\n\nRight now, I'm not doing much with it—just installing a few apps and working with Git. However, we recently got a new colleague who specializes in Linux administration. At the moment, he's taking a Udemy course and shared his account with me so I can do it too.\n\nNow I'm wondering if I should buy a used laptop for around €150 to learn Linux at home. Do you think it makes sense for the future to have experience with Linux as a developer? Also, is there a way to combine my projects with Linux? I'm still a beginner in programming, but if there's a way to integrate both, that would be really useful, right?\n\n  \nEdit: Thanks, btw, for all your help!

This is because they have been burned by Windows sneaking in undesirable features, reinstalling applications (Edge) that they explicitly uninstalled, and even forcibly updating to Windows 11 from 10. They are justifiably looking to delete something that has, on the surface, harmed them in the past.\n\nBut they do not understand that auto-updates exist for a legitimate reason. Software bug fixes, QOL and Accessibility enhancements, and most critically, patching SECURITY vulnerabilities that must be done *immediately*!! Users should NOT be responsible for being proactive about this stuff, the vendors should! Auto-Updates are Good, Actually. I even allow my Arch to do it!\n\nI, of course, place the blame firmly at Microsoft. Their piggybacking on a security essential to push customer-unfriendly things all out of greed has directly contributed to a paranoia that directly hinders public safety.\n\nBut, open-source is here to repair the harm caused by corporate greed. **How can the Linux community as a whole contribute to lessening this paranoia and restore trust in those that actually work to keep their personal devices safe?**",

    "body": "**EDIT:** Original post kept down below to keep consistency with the comments, but I wanted to take a moment to address the legitimate criticism my snarky, off-the-cuff post has received by making a more serious version of this post that is actually helpful.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you are reading this post, you are either...\n\n * ... new to Linux and have chosen Kali as your first distribution, if so, **this post is for you.**\n * ... not new to Linux and take issue with the title, if so, **this post is not for you, but you will comment anyway.**\n * ... studying cyber security and are wondering why you shouldn't install it, **this post is not intended for you.**\n\nFirst, welcome to Linux, you're in for an exciting ride! Learning to use Linux is like experiencing computers for the first time again, a lot of your knowledge about Windows can be thrown out the window and you get to rediscover what makes computing fun again. Unfortunately, getting started with Linux can be overwhelming for newcomers, with a lot of choices to select from but a lack of knowledge to make the right choice for yourself.\n\nLately there's been an influx of people who are installing Kali as their daily driver, main Linux distribution to use for desktop usage; asking questions that are a direct result of misunderstanding what Kali is for and ignoring the strong advice of the distribution to not use it that way. Such questions are a waste of everyone time's including your own, but more importantly, may discourage you from trying to use Linux again by assuming that that is the normal experience.\n\n**Why shouldn't I install Kali?**\n\nDo not just take my word for it, read the documentation: https://docs.kali.org/introduction/should-i-use-kali-linux\n\nBut in short: Kali Linux is a hyper specialized distribution meant for security experts, penetration testers and the likes. It is not meant to be used as a general purpose operating system. The ideal way to use Kali Linux is from an USB stick or, even better, a virtual machine. Kali is more like a tool suite than an operating system.\n\n**I want a secure distro and Kali is a security distro!**\n\nKali Linux is not a secure distribution of Linux in the defensive sense, it is an *offensive* security distribution. The tools that it comes with are specifically meant to attack networks. The tools Kali Linux comes with are dangerous, and if used improperly can even lead *to serious legal consequences.*\n\nIf you want a secure defensive Linux distribution, you have many alternatives such as *Parrot Home Edition* as an example.\n\n**I watched Mr Robot and I want to become a cool hackerman and you're wrong so I'm going to do it anyway.**\n\nGo ahead, no one is stopping you from throwing caution to the wind. The best case scenario is that you'll get bored of it within a few hours, the worst case scenario is that you think this is what Linux is about. It's not, Linux is normally very convenient and easy to work with, read on to learn more.\n\nFurthermore, do not expect to get any help. The people in r/kalilinux will mock you for ignoring the documentation; and people here will most likely tell you to install something else.\n\n**Okay, I tried it and my infosec dreams are shattered, I hacked my local coffeeshop's wifi and got arrested, and I cannot use computers anymore.**\n\nI warned you!!\n\n**What Linux distribution should I actually install if I am new to Linux?**\n\nGenerally speaking, Ubuntu is highly recommended to newcomers as this is the most supported distribution by most third party software developers like Valve, Discord and many others. It is very popular and you will have the most luck finding solutions to issues you are likely to run into as many people will have had the same problems you did.\n\nThat said, Linux distributions come in many shapes, sizes, flavors and colors and you are encouraged to experiment and try for yourself. Some other distributions that are suitable for beginners (though some are easier than others) are:\n\n- Linux Mint\n- Pop_OS!\n- Manjaro Linux\n- OpenSuSE\n- Fedora Linux\n- Debian\n\nGood luck in your Linux journey!\n\nOld post\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRepeat after me:\n\n * Kali Linux is for pentesters, you are not to install it, the documentation for Kali tells you this.\n * If you think you'd like to use Kali as a desktop OS, you aren't ready to use an OS like Kali in any capacity.\n * No, you're not cool for installing Kali, it doesn't make you a hacker, just install Ubuntu.\n\nFeel free to `sed s/Kali/Parrot/` too, and any other pentesting, security oriented OS.",

    "body": "#What's going on?\n\nA recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app **permanently inaccessible** to users.\n\nOn May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/) to [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/) to [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/).\n\nEven if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface [](/ajwtf \"and everything that goes with it!\").\n\nThis isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.\n\n#What's the plan? \n\nOn June 12th, [many subreddits](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away *permanently* unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because *we love Reddit*, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.\n\nThe two-day blackout isn't the *goal*, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.\n\nWhat can *you* do?\n\n1. **Complain.** Message the mods of /r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit: submit a [support request](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new): comment in relevant threads on /r/reddit, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/.), leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.\n\n2. **Spread the word.** Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at /r/ModCoord  - but please don't pester mods you *don't* know by simply spamming their modmail.\n\n3. **Boycott *and* spread the word...to Reddit's competition!** Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite *non*-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!\n\n4. **Don't be a jerk.** As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible. **This includes not harassing moderators of subreddits who have chosen not to take part**: no one likes a missionary, a used-car salesman, or a flame warrior.",

What I don’t understand is that I gave this live VM 50GB, so I thought it would be enough. Would I need more? What would I need to do to effectively upgrade this monstrosity? \n\n\nEDIT: I fixed the storage issue, but now there is an issue with releasing the upgrade. See this image \n[Terminal Output](https://i.stack.imgur.com/FyF53.png) . \n\nEDIT 2: Thank you everyone for your comments, suggestions, and ideas! Yes, I am serious about trying to modernize Hannah Montana Linux. I want today’s individuals to feel an active and updated HML. It’s a personal project of mine.

    "body": "3 years ago, I \"hacked\" the school (I actually just changed permissions on my user folder that the school gave me, so no one could access it). I was told not to do it again and that was pretty much the end of it. I have been using Linux as my main operating system for just over 2 years. In these 2 years there have been no problems with me doing this and many teachers knew that I was using it.\n\nJust this week however, I was accused of \"hacking\" again, when actually it was another kid who was just ddosing the network so he had an excuse not to do work. Before they found him however, I was investigated because of what I did 3 years ago and was told that if I did not hand over my laptop and usbs, they would call in the police. Now, since the time I \"hacked\" the school, I have been very interested in how people do actual hacks and have tried multiple scripts on personal computers, BUT NEVER ON THE SCHOOL NETWORK. One of the usbs they checked had ncat for windows on it and a rootkit script on it. They have since then told me that I am not able to use my personal computer unless I use windows and reformat the Linux partition or use one the school loaned Pentium computers.\n\nThis is the most stupid thing I have ever heard, but they will hear none of the legitimate reasons people actually use Linux. I am wondering if there are any laws or rights that I can bring up in order to keep using Linux or if there are any methods of disguising Linux as windows in order to keep using it? I live in Australia if that helps with finding laws. Anything would be very much appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks Heaps for all the ideas, I really appreciate it, and I'll be sure to update you guys on what happens.\n\nEdit 2: There seems to be a bit of confusion on who owns the computer that I do school work on. The laptop is mine, and they are currently wanting me to use one of there school laptops that has windows installed on it because that means I’m not allowed to install anything on it, it should be free if I did choose to however (I’m not going to though). I am definitely considering just asking to be disconnected from the network instead of changing operating systems since I can just use mobile data.\n\nEdit 3: A bit late, but better than never. The result of this ended up being me given a school laptop instead of allowing me to use mine while at school. Their logic in this was that if another incident were to happen with their system, I would not be less suspicious as I am using a locked down system. This is pretty annoying, but definatly not the worst thing to happen in the world and I am super fortunate that they didn't just suspend me for having crap on my USB.  ",

How fucked I am?\n\n[Here is the output of](https://imgur.com/a/cwRKf1m) `ps aux | grep systemd`.   \nI tried to kill it, yet it keeps respawning. And it seems to hook itself with `cgmanager`. How can I disable that?     \n\n\n\n**EDIT 1:** [I also noticed whenever I enter the graphical shell (`startx`), the trojan `systemd` binary starts itself in /tmp](https://i.imgur.com/1eqz2ky.png). How can I locate the source that execute the file?\n\n\n\n\n**EDIT 2:** I removed `cgmanager` although I think it doesn't have to do with `systemd` here.  \nAnyway I figured out how the malware works. First it tries to run itself from /tmp/, if it doesn't run, it runs itself either from /.local/share or from /.config/.   \nI added `noexec` to /tmp, that actually stopped a couple of malware names from running (basically the names that the malware use to disguise itself are: `gvfs`, `initctl`, `ibus-x11`, `dbus-daemon`, `systemd`, and others.   \n\nI installed socklog, how can I use it (or any other logging software) to trace the automatic execution    \n\n\n**EDIT 3:** **I found the source**   \n2 files (`~/.ssh/config/service/ssh-agent`, and `~/.local/share/icc/icc-daemon`). Somehow my `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile` were modified to let these files to start up (noticed that when changing users the program didn't start). [Here is a screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/voi8aC3).\n\nAnyway, I still have the binaries of the files, just to inspect them later, if anyone wants to take a look let me know. So far, I think I solved it. But my ssh keys are fucked I guess.\n\n\n**FINAL UPDATE** Thanks to u/AN3223 for pointing it out, the source seems to come from an **addon for Kodi**, according to [discussions on linux forums](https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-mint-84/recent-update-causes-high-cpu-usage-4175636164/page2.html), [majaro's forums](https://forum.manjaro.org/t/weird-folder-in-tmp-on-boot-kodi-plugins-related/56603/15), [pclinuxos](https://www.pclinuxos.com/forum/index.php/topic,146020.0.html) and a [blog post on how to get rid of it](http://www.lieberbiber.de/2018/09/04/a-look-a-the-linux-coinminer-bc-malware/), and some users on reddit also ran into this exact malware [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace/comments/7wruj9/psa_i_found_a_virustrojanminer_in_kodi_arch_linux/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Addons4Kodi/comments/9fjc1g/cryptominer_in_gaia/).   \n[u/funfollower](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/ernlku/i_found_out_i_have_a_trojan_on_my_machine/ff5rcir/) pointed that [the vulnerability has been investigated 5 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace/comments/8dx7nj/psa_please_check_if/).",

Not sure why after all those years there's not even an unofficial way to just run them via Wine or whatever it's now called.\n\nAlso I can't understand why are people so hesitant to switch to Linux. Feels like there's something I'm missing. \n\nOne question tho - I hear people switching distros from time to time, but how do you keep your stuff? Is it the same like when you upgrade Windows, you just reinstall the system and all your stuff stays?\n\nOh and one more for people that need to run Windows programs often: how do you do that? Dual boot is just too slow and inconvenient.\n\nThanks.",

I have a google account with 2FA.\n\nSuddenly the browser windows started opening up and windows/tabs moving (I saw from the other side of the room) “your computer's going crazy” says my wife.\n\nI quickly turned off wifi via hard switch, shut browser and notice a big yellow sticky note (applet) open on my kde desktop with following notes (which I did not write!):\n\n“*Schindler's List”, standing on his balcony p...*\n\n*Extreme*\n\n*12:37*\n\n*The Extraordinary Voyage of the Polish Submarine Orzel*\n\nThe first two lines appear to be a youtube video copy-paste from the notes “Schindlers...”, Extreme being the channel name (rather distasteful!).\n\nThe second two lines seem to be the duration (12:37) and title of another youtube video “The Extraordinary...”\n\nForensics:\n\nIn Firefox, I can see the history:\n\n20:11 he opened my reddit inbox (in a FF container) – nothing has changed on this page.\n\n20:11 he opened a bookmarked Google Doc – this opens in a new FF Container with me logged in.\n\n20:12 he opened Google login page – probably autofilled my username via lastpass\n\n20:12 he opened Google password page – probably autofilled via lastpass\n\n20:14 he clicked on a video link in an already open tab – loud dialogue started causing me to think “what the hell...someone's in my computer!!”\n\n20:14 run over to laptop, see incognito window closing, and see two NoScript popups open (#tab13 and #tab 17) with message about cross site scripting.\n\nHow did he get in?\n\nWhat could he have done?\n\nI can't see anything unusual in journald or system logs – any others to check? Can I see if he accessed my files?\n\nI immediately changed my lastpass password and Google password on another PC.\n\nThanks for any suggestions on why or how. I'll reformat this laptop!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT 1: I had just added the Smart Referer addon about 20 mins previously, if this has any relevance.\n\nEDIT 2: Reading a bit, maybe it was a XSS attack. I was on the Invidious website (youtube proxy site) and that is where the copy-pastes on my clipboard and on the sticky note seem to have come from.\n\nEDIT 3: On my clipboard is text from the open [invidio.us](https://invidio.us) page - seems pretty unfocused copy-pasting. This seems related to the material on the yellow sticky note, but is not the same.\n\nEDIT4: **Wow**, I realise from the number of posts that the potential implications are massive, but you have suggested several things that may point to a more **mundane** explanation:\n\n* No ssh or remote control software installed, therefore this would require a highly unlikely breaking out of the sandboxed Firefox. It is pretty much a fresh install with just my files and Tbird/Firefox configured.\n* My addons should block all 3rd party scripts (notably NoScript and Ublock Origin, but others also). I've checked and there are no scripts running on the page I had open ([invideo.us](https://invideo.us)) according to NoScript\n* I'm pretty sure that the iso is legit since it is downloaded from the official torrent with multiple seeders - I'll check the sha56sum tonight. I'll also check the proton cli downloaded from the proton vpn site.\n* Significantly all the actions are focused in the top right hand of the screen (incognito, open/close windows, bookmarked google doc in toolbar, google login, reddit inbox). \n* Kde shortcut exists on trackpad allowing copy-pasting to notes (and clipboard) via the trackpad\n* Seemingly random nature of material copy-pasted.\n* Laptop sitting on woollen cushion with my metal spectacles placed close to trackpad (static?). \n* No anomalies in the log files I've looked at so far\n* I'm a pretty boring person and unlikely to be the target of nation states or sophisticated hackers\n\nI am starting to think (hope) that trackpad was buggy, perhaps related to spectacles and static, and that the cursor somehow drifted to the upper right of the screen and started hammering on links and functions in that area, by chance doing something rather surprising (e.g. creating sticky note and pasting into it!).\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

    "title": "Sad state of hardware accelerated video on linux browser",
    "body": "At present, a user has only two options for a reasonable browser as firefox and chromium. All other browsers are either derivatives of above, or simply unsuitable for modern use (couple of webkit based mayb be usable but I have little idea how to enable hardware acceleration on them). So i will detail the steps required to enable browser hardware accelerated video on both and how there are compromises in either. My graphics card is amd 260x with open source amdgpu driver. CPU is i7 2600k.\n\nBefore starting, let me answer why a user would prefer to enable hardware acceleration in first place:\n\n1. Improve battery life in portable devices\n2. Save CPU resources for other tasks\n3. Prevent excess fan noise / cpu heating\n\n# Firefox\n\nFirefox currently supports hardware acceleration on both x11 and wayland. I tested on firefox 96 (nightly) to give best shot possible. So the following settings need to be changed in `about:config`:\n\n    media.ffmpeg.vaapi.enabled\ttrue\n    gfx.webrender.all\t        true\n    media.ffvpx.enabled             false\n\nIn addition, while running X11, firefox should be launched with variable `MOZ_X11_EGL=1` . Also, users should ensure that vaapi is available by installing/running `vainfo` in terminal. In cases where gpu only supports h.264 decode, its beneficial to install [h.264ify](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/h264ify/).\n\nWhat works:\n\n1. both 30fps/60fps or higher videos play smoothly at resolutions supported by gpu decoder.\n2. CPU usage is significantly reduced while playing videos\n\nThe problems:\n\n1. The colour of videos appears washed out. (0,0,0) is mapped to (16,16,16) and (255,255,255) to (235,235,235). [Bug 1726186](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1726186). Edit - bug was fixed in version 96\n2. Nvidia users out of luck (for now)\n\n# Chromium\n\nChromium also supports hardware acceleration in x11 and wayland. This too was tested in chromium-dev 97. To enable it, first set `chrome://flags/#ignore-gpu-blocklist` to `disabled`. Then launch chromium with following flags:\n\n    --use-gl=desktop --enable-features=VaapiVideoDecoder\n\nIn theory, `--use-gl=desktop` should not be required in wayland, but I couldn't get it to work without it. Also h.264ify will be required as stated above.\n\nWhat works:\n\n1. both 30fps/60fps or higher videos play smoothly at resolutions supported by gpu decoder, unless vulkan backend is enabled through flags. However there is little reason to enable it for now\n2. Videos are played colour accurately\n\nThe problems:\n\n1. CPU usage reduction is minimal. I could not observe significant improvement in reduction of cpu load or improved battery life ( on different machine) despite confirming that hardware video acceleration was working while playing videos\n2. Nvidia users out of luck again\n\n# Epiphany/Gnome Web\n\nBased on GTKwebkit, it provides another option for users that may be not as powerful as chrome or firefox, but still fairly usable for modern web. To enable hardware accelerated video, first install `gstreamer-vaapi` for amd/intel gpus or `gst-plugins-bad` and `nvidia-utils` for nvidia GPUs. Then run:\n\n    gsettings set org.gnome.Epiphany.web:/ hardware-acceleration-policy 'always'\n\nWhat works:\n\n1. both 30fps/60fps or higher videos play smoothly at resolutions supported by gpu decoder\n2. Videos are colour accurate\n3. Works for nvidia users\n4. Good reduction in CPU usage\n\nThe problems:\n\n1. Lack of extensions\n2. No simple way to limit video codec to h.264, hence older GPUs will lack hardware video acceleration in most videos with codecs other than h.264\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nCompared to windows, where hardware video acceleration is enabled by default in most hardware, the same needs to be set up in linux and compromises needed to be made. I find little reason to enable hardware video acceleration in chrome, since it fails to do the single most important function of saving cpu resources. In case of firefox, there is some benefit, but one has to bear with washed out, dull videos.\n\nThe best method currently to enjoy online videos is setting to launch either VLC or MPV when video is played in any of these browsers. It will lower CPU utilization greater than firefox, and videos will be colour accurate. However thanks to DRM streaming services and custom video players that are abundant online, this approach is applicable only to some websites.\n\nIn case some users are aware about workarounds, do post in comments.\n\nEdit: many commenters claim that the bug mentioned above for firefox does not affect them. I couldn't find anything different in configs, so it may be related to some specific hardware. In that case, firefox may currently be the best browser on linux for playing online videos\n\nEdit2: Added Gnome web/Epiphany on advice of u/rayi512x\n\n**Edit 3:** [**Bug 1726186**](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1726186) **in firefox has been resolved in version 96. This alleviates almost all problems with firefox except good nvidia support, making it ideal for amd and intel users**",

    "body": "\\[RESOLVED\\]\n\nI managed to get this resolved. Sadly, it is completely anticlimactic and not at all the fancy, whimsical issue I was hoping to delight you all with. Nevertheless, I am truly grateful for all the help I have received here. Thank you!  \n**tldr:** it was a cronjob, but not one in the OS, in the zyxel software, and it was misbehaving;\n\n**Longer version:** I went all \"10 second tom\" on ita nd dug through the files, seconds at a time. Mostly everybody pointed at a job/scheduler thing - so when I was digging through /tmp a file named  scheduler.log stood out. crawling through through it I found references to a zyxel utility (`/usr/bin/zydbcli`). Called it and got a help screen. Then called `/usr/bin/zydbcli --queryschall`   \nand low and behold, there was a job in there to reboot the nas every first Tuesday of the month at 8:00 am. Which fiit the bill, since it went into a boot loop yesterday. Removed that using the same utility, and the boot loop has stopped, effectively resolving the issue. Again, this does not show up in crontab (for any user) so I'm writing this off as an issue with zyxel's software, and will sotp wasting everybody's time.  \nAgain, many, many thanks!\n\nOriginal post &gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nYes, you read that right. Every year, in December, my small linux box goes into a continous boot loop. Sometime after New Year it will start working normally like nothing ever happenned.\n\nOk, now let me give you a little background. I'm a developer, so I have a technical background but sysadmin stuff is not my strong suit. This is a Zyxel NSA320 NAS which, after installing some package from its interface is now also running some minimalistic linux. I get command line access (ssh) and have transmission and minidlna running on it - nothing more. It's basically a torrentbox/mediacenter.\n\nWhat I found is that it is actually accessible via ssh for a few seconds before rebooting. 5-10 seconds at most. So I could potentially run predefined command or script on it and get its output.\n\nFirst time it happenned, I almost wrote it off as broken until it just started working again. This is now the 4th year it's doing this - and I figured why not, this is an odd enough thing, somebody might actually enjoy troubleshooting this (I know I will).I've tried the usual poweroff, completely unplug, even disconnected from the network entirely, re-seated the HDD inside (out of desperation). To no availa, when december comes, it goes on vacation.\n\nI'm at a loss here - don't even know where to start. Is anybody kind enough or curious enough to give this a try?\n\nLE: spellchecksedit 1: Managed to do a ps -ef right before getting kicked out.

Like I couldn't open a video in a paint file\n\nOnce I started using Linux, I began to realise that the purpose of files is not defined by their extension, and its the program that decides how to read a file.\n\nFor example I can use Node to run .js files but when I removed the extension it still continued to work\n\nExtensions are basically only for semantic purposes it seems, but arent really required\n\nWhen I switched from Ubuntu to Arch, having to manually setup my partitions during the installation I took notice of how my volumes e.g. /dev/sda were also *just files*, I tried opening them in neovim only to see nothing inside. \n\nBut somehow that emptiness stores the information required for my file systems\n\nIn linux literally everything is a file, it seems. Files store some metadata like creation date, permissions, etc.\n\nThis makes me feel like a file can be thought of as an HTML document, where the &lt;head&gt; contains all the metadata of the file and the &lt;body&gt; is what we see when we open it with a text editor, would this be a correct way to think about them?\n\nIs there anything in linux that is *not* a file? \n\nIf everything is a file, then to run those files we need some sort of executable (compiler etc.) which in itself will be a file. There needs to be some sort of \"initial file\" that will be loaded which allows us to load the next file and so on to get the system booted. (e.g. a the \"spark\" which causes the \"explosion\")\n\nHow can this initial file be run if there is no files loaded before this file? Would this mean the CPU is able to execute the file directly on raw metal or what? I just cant believe that in linux literally everything is a file. I wonder if Windows is the same, is this fundamentally how operating systems work?\n\nIn the context of the HTML example what would a binary file look like?

    "body": "My humblest thanks to you for taking the time to read my post! I apologize for the beginner questions.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBeen using only windows since Windows 95. I'm hoping to move to Linux because I'd like to reduce data mining, increase privacy and get away from big tech, with the hopes that I could still keep the functionality I'm used to &amp; I'm tired of windows breaking. \n\nThis is what I currently use my PC for every day: LibreOffice, E-mails (Thunderbird portable), calendar, listening to music, Bitwarden, reading (Firefox), watching movies (Smplayer), privacy/security (Adguard), TeamViewer (to help my elderly mother who lives very far away).\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI value a friendly community, large user base (who has probably encountered problems I run into, so I can learn from their solutions or ask for advice), stability, ability to configure GUI, dark theme (my eyes are very sensitive), large selection of all sorts of customization, easy to use GUI.\n\n    Hardware\n    Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8700K CPU @ 3.70GHz (12 CPUs), ~3.7GHz\n    Memory: 32768MB RAM\n    NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti\n    Scarlett 2i2 USB \n    wifi TP-LINK WRL ADAPTER 3000MBPS PCIEARCHER TX3000E TP-LI (chipset wi-fi 6 AX600)\n\nI've watched hours worth of videos online, read comparisons and think that one of this Linux distros might be the right one for someone like me. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nAt the moment the latest Windows 10 update broke my system again, I somehow got it working, but I don't know how long it will work and if I can fix it up again. I want to pick a distro asap &amp; install it tomorrow when I get up. Money is tight, so if at all possible, I'd like to save the 80 € that it would cost to fix my pc with diagnostics &amp; Windows 10 in a repair shop if my skills aren't enough. \n\nSo these are the distros I found (note, all the info I post below I found online, on websites, YouTube, forums &amp; I am very much aware that I can be wrong about these points, so please correct me if I am wrong). \n\n    Zorin\n    + looks modern out of the box\n    + easy to use\n    + new drivers included\n    + better software selection included\n    + big community \n    + big development team \n    - could be more functional \n    - not very customizable (in comparison to mint)\n    - got caught data mining IPs without disclosing it while claiming to respect privacy (major concern for me) \n    - ultimate edition costs money (I don't mind paying for software, it just feels off to me, considering Linux is open source, not a big deal in total)\n    - I found a few people having performance issues on Zorin (that they didn't have on other Linux distros) - should this be something to worry about? \n    \n    Mint\n    + reliable \n    + very functional \n    + very customizable \n    + big community \n    + big development team \n    + very customizable \n    + free\n    - looks dated \n    - could be more user-friendly \n    \n    Feren \n    + looks modern out of the box\n    + easy to use\n    + free\n    - small development team (1 developer?) - I'm afraid that \n    \n    Pop-os\n    + looks modern\n    + free\n    + well funded development \n    - while it looks modern, it looks a bit alien to me (coming from Windows)\n\n**Please help me pick one that suits me the best in your opinion.** \n\n1. If you think that I should know anything before picking any of these distros please share your know how. \n\n2. If you think that I should use a different distro instead, please guide me (and if possible, briefly mention why). \n\n\nThank you from the bottom of my heart. I know this text was long. I tried to make it as short as possible, while giving all the needed details. If you happen to know any info, even about one of those distros or my questions, please comment! CHeers :)",

    "body": "TL; DR - My desktop went from a disgusting mess to completely empty.\n\nI switched from using only Windows my whole life to Linux full-time about a year ago, and a big change for me was using a file structure that actually made sense. Basically, I'd spent all of my years participating in the disgusting practice of: 1) Accumulate a bunch of files on your desktop. 2) When your desktop becomes too full, create a New Folder, and throw it all in there. 3) Repeat until you have half a dozen New Folders on your desktop. 4) Create one more New Folder, put all the others inside that. 5) Repeat.\n\nThe biggest reason for that was probably just that the file structures didn't make much sense to me on Windows. Yeah, if you opened the file manager, there were Pictures, Videos, etc. on the left, but trying to figure out what was actually going on was weird to me. Had to go to the top level where Program Files and what not were, then Users, then choose my account out of a handful of other options that were there despite me being the only user, then you find the Desktop, Documents, etc., along with a bunch of other folders and files I'd never seen before. Why bother with all that when I can just stay comfy on the Desktop and Downloads folders?\n\nSwitching to Linux, I took the time to actually learn the file structures and why most of the directories were there, on root and user levels, and things made sense to me. Like, it makes sense that `/home/kavb333/` is my user's home directory, where my Desktop, Documents, etc. are, and it makes sense that my .config, .cache, etc. would be there, too. Of course the high level user stuff is just at `~/&lt;here&gt;` because that's the home directory. So after I made the switch, I took a day or two out of my time to go through the disgusting war crime I committed over the years to my desktop, and put things into the directories they actually belong, and now my Desktop is almost always empty.",

This may be because the hardware is optimised more for Windows, but even when it comes to gesture support beyond 2 finger scrolling, every solution I've found maps gestures to keyboard shortcuts. This is good in a vacuum, but when gestures on Windows and Macs feel a lot better integrated (instead of the scrolling action feeling incremental, the action on-screen directly correlates to your finger movement, down to the smallest movement), it makes me wonder why Linux seems to be so behind in this regard. In order for Linux to truly become a mainstream competitor to Windows and Mac, in my opinion, a competitive trackpad is essential.\n\nThis isn't me bashing Linux; I love the UI customisability and genuinely want the adoption of Linux to grow - I'm just curious out of concern; what's limiting the Linux trackpad?",

It's what stopped me from switching to Linux years ago when I was considering it. Luckily with Fedora, it still works.\n\nThanks to everyone who commented to help me. I'm excited to learn more about the wonders of Linux.  \n\n\n\n\nOriginal: The other night I did an update for Windows 10. I regret it so much. My laptop won't turn on properly. When it finally did load, it ran horribly. \n\n I tried to rollback before the updates but the OS is running so shitty, I can even get to the settings to see if there's a rollback available. \n\nSo now I'm like, fuck it. Let's give Linux a try. I tried years ago, but I had issues finding a distro  that let me do pinch and zoom with my trackpad. Now I don't care about that anymore. I need a working laptop with an OS that doesn't terrify me everytime there's an update. I blocked Windows updates for almost 2 years because it fucked up my computer last time. This time is even worse. \n\n\nI'm not a computer expert but I can read and follow directions pretty well. I've done things like install custom ROMs on my phones without bricking them. A lil effort to get my tech to work won't scare me. Though I prefer something that's simple to use for newbies. I need to be able to get online and have my camera and mic working properly out the box so I can work. Give me that and I'll figure out the rest as I go. \n\nI have a Thinkpad X240 if that matters.",

During the conversation, this exchange took place:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&gt; I don't wanna wear out the battery by plugging it in. \n\nAh, okay, now I get it. I hate to tell you this, but here are the facts of battery life:\n\n* Not plugging in your laptop except to recharge the battery **wears out your battery**.\n\n* But plugging in your laptop -- leaving your laptop plugged in most of the time -- **does not wear out your battery**. \n\nAn intelligent laptop battery charger only charges the battery to about 80% *in the long term* (depending on the battery type), then maintains that charge level, neither adding to nor subtracting from the charge level. In the short term the charger provide 100% charge, but over a longer period, this charge level is allowed to decline.\n\nWhen the laptop is plugged in, when it's in use, *all the power comes from the charger, not the battery*. So the battery, neither being charged nor discharged, has a very long life.\n\nIf the laptop is not plugged in when in use, the battery must provide all the operating power, and that power must be replaced periodically. This means the battery is constantly being charged and discharged, *which substantially shortens the battery's life.*\n\nA battery's service lifetime is measured by how many charge/discharge cycles it can tolerate. *If you want to wear out your battery, by all means force it to charge and discharge every day.* The best way to destroy your laptop's battery is to use it without line power, then plug it in and force a recharge, every day.\n\nIf you do this, the computer manufacturers will love you, because you'll be replacing your laptops like clockwork, especially now that new-laptop batteries can't even be accessed/removed/replaced any more.\n\nADDENDUM: This is true for electric cars also:\n\n[Electric car battery life: how to preserve your battery](https://www.drivingelectric.com/your-questions-answered/96/electric-car-battery-life-how-preserve-your-battery) : \"A battery expert on a Tesla forum (with a PhD in electromechanical engineering) recommends keeping your state of charge between 15% and 90%, others 25%-75%, but advice varies. Some say 20%-80%, but fundamentally, the rule is don’t overcharge it or let it go completely flat.\"\n\nOne may ask what relevance electric car batteries have for laptop batteries. As it turns out, they're the same batteries, just more of them.\n\n[ Removed background reference -- not really relevant, after all. ]\n\nEDIT: clarification and other changes.",

    "body": "Moved from r/linux:\n\nSo my boss hates Linux. He thinks it's insecure, \"this strange operating system\", and not what businesses use.\n\nCurrently  we have a few embedded IoT type products that use Linux (no GUI).  Recently, he's been obsessed with cyber-security. Recent ransomware  attacks on peer companies have put the fear of god into him. So he's  hired an IT group and because they have almost no experience with Linux,  we support those servers and they support our Windows servers. Most  people in our office use windows, but a few developers use virtual  machines to use Linux and Windows. This is because the developers prefer  Linux, but also we have products to support.\n\nSo  far he's refrained some forcing us to use Windows on our laptops  full-time, but he wants to switch all of our embedded products over to  something other than Linux. Apparently one customer didn't want to buy  our product because it used Linux (which they never would have even seen  because configuration is via web browser), so now he's assuming that  customer knows something he doesn't.\n\nAny  tips on convincing him Linux isn't some hobby toy? I just want him to  make decisions based on real information and not his own bias. I doubt  he'll want to listen to me much because he knows I prefer Linux, however  I also use Windows when it's the right tool.",

Again, for a media server, I’ve found that running in Docker can negatively affect ability to transcode and access all threads/core of the processor.

My school is VERY serious about formatting so I think I'll stick to MS Office for now. Once I switch to Linux I'll use Office 365 with my school account, so it's free of costs. I'm still going to give LibreOffice a try though. Again, thank you everyone! :)",

(\"if TeRRy Davis CoULd do iT, why cAN't I\") But after experiencing the true pain of developing it solo, the only way to keep myself from going insane was giving up. Unfortunately i cant change my project since it's already registered.\n\nSo i thought of using bare arch linux or something similar as the base, and just building a desktop environment on top of it. The unique thing about my os was supposed to be \"story mode\" or \"narrative driven\" feature. Like, the shell is a living personality (also main character) and all other basic apps are side characters. I still want to implement this idea.\n\nMy question is how do i build this desktop environment, i got ideas like building a desktop app using electron js and linking it with some window manager. that's the only way i thought of to complete this project.\n\nI'm open to any other better/easier alternatives?

I've used Linux as a desktop OS a number of times throughout the years, however, I've never really been able to stick with it, and have always gone back to macOS.\n\nI really love the macOS ecosystem and how seamless it is to switch between my phone and computer, including copy and paste, text messages, Airdrop, etc.\n\nI am wondering if there is a way to set up something similar in Linux? From what I've seen the platform is very disjointed.\n\nMy other problem is that I need to be able to support both Windows and Linux easily, and I feel like macOS sits right in the middle, with a lot of Windows GUI apps, and a lot of the same/similar Linux CLI apps, and it makes supporting both OSes very easy.\n\nDo you have any suggestions on replicating/replacing these features?",

    "body": "I have been researching an issue I have been having with my Manjaro installation for the last few days and several times have wanted to make a post on either the Manjaro or ArchLinux subreddits requesting help and/or guidance. First off, I know I am not owed help by anyone from the community and I am very appreciative for any help I do receive. I try to help others with their issues whenever I can because I love Linux and I love the community. I really want new users to discover all the freedom Linux has to offer and I would like to help others with their journey in any way I can.\n\nOne thing that greatly irritates me is the elitist gatekeeping attitude I see on the Manjaro and Arch forums. I know this isn't exclusive to these two distros but it seems to be the most prevalent. Whenever I research an issue I see forum post, after forum post of people asking the same questions I have hoping to fix a similar issue only for them to be told to RTFM, STFW, Google is your friend, etc. They also sometimes Link to [How to Ask Questions the Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html). This is the most condescending thing I have ever been linked to that I can recall.\n\nTo me it seems like the same people who are complaining about Microsoft's dominance in the desktop market are the same ones who are driving away new would-be Linux users. Why is there so much gate-keeping? I thought we all wanted Linux to be as successful, if not more so than Windows. Why is this chunk of the community being so toxic? I know it's not everybody, and is most likely just the vocal minority.\n\nAm I the only one who feels this way? If it's just me I'll shut up then.\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone so much! This has been a great discussion so far and I have enjoyed reading your replies. Also, thanks to everyone who has offered advice, and also those who have shared their thoughts about the essay and the broader topic in general. You guys are awesome! Thank you!",

This is enough to develop with I am concerned trying to run a virtual machine on it might push it over the edge.\n\nAs Linux users have been so supportive of my previous game I would hate to delay the launch of the Linux version. I am, therefore, in the search of a hero who wouldn't mind installing a beta version of the game via a steam key and giving it a spin. As I say I'd only need you to boot it up, and making sure it doesn't crash for a while and as a (small) reward you would of course be allowed to keep the game as well as play it before anyone else in the world, and (more importantly) have my eternal gratitude.\n\nI have 5 keys to giveaway on a first come first serve basis to whomever comments, it would be helpful if you could include your discords as well just to speed up communication.\n\nYou can find the trailer at the top of my post history if you are interested but need a little push.\n\nMany thanks!\n\nEdit:\n\nFirstly, can I just say what an awesome community this is and a big thank you to everyone who's reached out offering to help. Unfortunately, I have given out all of the codes already. For those of you still interested in the game I'll leave a link here to the store page, you'll be able to get your hands on it fully tested and non-buggy on 5th of Feb for only $8: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1510800/The\\_Great\\_Plague\\_Exodus/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1510800/The_Great_Plague_Exodus/)\n\nThank you all once again.",

I mean, I use proprietary software for the sake of ease, for example I’m a gamer and I have an Nvidia GPU, I have no other choice but to either switch back to Windows to get the best performance in games, or use proprietary drivers which is really not a huge deal for me. I’m in for the pragmatism of getting things done with the best tools available FOSS or not, before sacrificing ease of use for restricting myself to it.\n\nWhat’s your reasoning behind this?
