    "title": "I dumped Omarchy and went back to a fresh un-opinionated Arch",
    "body": "I gave it about 63 days before I gave up on it. 60 days ago I thought it was awesome. The past 2 weeks it was just annoying. When it became a bootable iso image I was pretty sure they were going to lose me. I didn't want a new distro. I wanted Arch with a a preconfigured Hyprland and development environment.\n\nI think it is kind of funny/sad how the mindset is is break free from your Mac and then they give you a version of Arch that is becoming more and more Mac like in the sense that you need to use Alacritty if you want these tui's to work right, and their modified chromium if you want these web apps to work right. And, oh I see you changed your keybinds, we're going to just change those back even though you did it the way we suggested. DHH has come up with some newer ones and you'll probably like them better than yours.  What? It changes your whole workflow? Funny you should mention that because we're also going to replace your neovim settings too. You might as well just do things our way.\n\nYeah I know it is an opinionated install, I didn't realize it was going to be opinionated updates as well. Just not for me. I did get some benefit from using it. I discovered lazygit and a few other terminal based applications.\n\nSo now that I am back to a fresh Arch install I figured I would give Cosmic a go. I must say I am pretty impressed with it. I like being able to set tiling or floating per work space.\n\n\\*edit\\*\n\nI had a 2nd PC with Omarchy installed, a little HP Mini. I ended up removing Omarchy tonight and keeping my Arch install by doing the following steps.\n\nDisable the Omarchy seamless login service and renable tty1\n\n    sudo systemctl stop omarchy-seamless-login.service\n    sudo systemctl daemon-reload \n    sudo systemctl start getty@tty1.service\n\nIt is easier if you log in on tty2 (ctrl-alt f2) to do this, When you stop the seamless login service it might kick you to a black screen. Once you get rid of the auto login you can also remove the omarchy decryption graphic and replace it with something prettier. You only need to do this if you are using an encrypted disk. If you aren't using LUKS just skip to the .config folder part.\n\n\"plymouth-set-default-theme -l\" will show a list of the themes. I went with bgrt which is basically the spinner theme with your bios or PC manufacturer's boot logo. You need to make sure you specify the -R flag so it will rebuild the initramfs.\n\n    sudo plymouth-set-default-theme -R bgrt\n\nAt this stage I decided to just move my .config folder and start with a fresh one. You don't have to do this part. If you decide to keep your .config folder and keep hyprland, there is a pretty good chance it will get updated back to omarchy again.\n\n    cd \n    mv .config/ .config.bak \n    mkdir .config\n\nThen I just copied over folders I wanted to preserve and omitted things I didn't mind rebuilding from scratch. Below are just some examples. One thing of note. Omarchy symlinks the themes to a lot of their stuff so if you copy nvim or any of your terminal customizations you might want to consider copying the omarchy folder. At the time of writing this, it only has a themes folder and a current theme folder.\n\n    cd .config\n    cp -r ../.config.bak/chromium .\n    cp -r ../.config.bak/retroarch .\n    cp -r ../.config.bak/nvim .\n\nYou can reboot here. You should get a new plymouth screen with the Arch logo at the bottom and whatever theme you picked\n\nFinally you need to get rid of the omarchy mirror and update your mirror list.\n\n    sudo nvim /etc/pacman.conf\n\nscroll down and comment out or remove these lines.\n\n    [omarchy] \n    SigLevel = Optional TrustAll \n    Server = https://pkgs.omarchy.org/$arch\n\nSave it and then run this to rebuild your mirror list\n\n    sudo pacman -Syyu\n\nAt this point you just need to do one more thing, remove omarchy-chromium\n\n    sudo pacman -R omarchy-chromium\n\nYou can re-install the real Chromium if you want it. Having the omarchy fork there will be problematic if you ever want to update Chromium.\n\nNow you are free to install whatever desktop and window manager you would like to use. If you install SDDM you can set that to auto login and go right into whatever you install.\n\nOmarchy is still going to exist in .local/share/omarchy as a git repo. I am keeping it there so I can cannibalize their themes. :)\n\nI hope this proves useful to some people and gets you back to just using Arch btw.",

    "body": "So I'm a 19 y/o CSE student, and I have been using Acer Aspire A315-58 for 2 years now, which comes with Windows pre-installed. I used to run Ubuntu WSL because I was initially a little curious about Linux and I wanted to do some low-level systems programming, which was really complicated with Windows.\n\nFurthermore, my laptop heats up very quickly when I just boot up Windows (task manager giving me ridiculous usage percentages), and I think on 5 different occasions, my screen just melted and glitched so I'd have to restart it or wait some time before I can use it.\n\nHowever, after gradually migrating most of my things to Arch Linux in May 2025, I can say that this is probably the greatest decision I ever made. Before Arch, I never imagined this would be possible:\n\n- Updating everything in my system with just a simple \"yay -Syu\"\n- Have a simple quick package manager that gets me all my essentials\n- Almost no stress on my CPU, GPU and RAM on boot\n- Everything I'll ever need is in less than 100 GB\n- No registry editor hell\n- No \"app is not on my laptop but it's still in my program list\" bs\n- Really high performance\n- I'm more aware about whats really happening to my laptop under the hood\n- Laptop doesn't heat up and send my fan to the damn ER\n- Custom keybinds that make me less reliant on my mouse\n\n...and the list just goes on, man.\n\nToday marks 6 months of me using Arch Linux (+ Hyprland), and I am very, very happy that I moved out of Windows. To be honest I only still kept Windows as a fallback, or when I can't use something on Arch, but 99% of my usage is on Arch.\n\nI really want to thank a lot of YouTube channels and the Arch and the overall Linux community for making this happen for me man, this is just awesome.",

My first OS was windows xp, then 7, then windows 8(hated that by the way), used windows 10 and 11.... I have used linux distros too in between like ubuntu and kali Linux in my school days. Didn't really liked ubuntu. I liked kali but went back to windows because games and other things weren't supported properly on Linux. I just found windows better overall. Now, after windows dropped their windows 11 i noticed my laptop got slower and it felt like windows was just trying to monetize everything by showing me ads and useless info. Taskbar was filled with bunch of crap i never used. I saw PewDiePie video of him switching to Linux and thought maybe i should try it too for real and not just dual boot it and then come back to windows and i installed arch on my laptop and used hyprland. It was Fun trying to figure it out. It was kind of silly using terminal to change my brightness, breaking it and reinstalling it again🤣 soon after some time i got some hand of it. Experimented a little with dotfiles then found a project on GitHub called Hyde desktop environment, tried it, liked it, and then just used that till now. It's been more than 5 months now and recently i tried using windows on my friend's laptop and mannnn....it just felt soo slow...like...using mouse to move my cursor and then clicking on apps to open them...yuckkkkkk 🤣🤣 sounds kinda funny but i didn't expect that using arch for some months would make me hate windows soo much...i couldn't believe I used to use that shit for soo long... In uni while all struggle to set up virtual environments for their python project i do it in seconds in my terminal. Everything still doesn't work perfectly out of box on Linux but still the fact that you can just fix it is soo amazing.. and now with all the tools like chatgpt, if you have any problem just copy all the errors from terminal and it'll guide you step by step how to fix it. Using arch has completely changed my perspective on how you should use a computer and how OS should be meant to serve you....now I can't even imagine going back to windows or use any other os like mac os",

I was about to upgrade my PC anyway so why not experiment? In a call with my friends I said that I’m done with the Microsoft crap and I left the call and immediately went to install arch. And post install it was just as good as I thought it would be, I started with KDE, downloaded all my stuff, transferred files and it all worked perfectly.

I’ve been using Ubuntu on WSL for several years now to access tools I use for my teaching and research that are a pain to get running on Windows, but lately I’ve been running into more and more issues which I chalked up to outdated packages, but is more likely than not due to my own haphazard setup.\n\nOn a whim, I decided to give Arch Linux a shot. After some amusing misunderstandings (where’s `vi`? …where’s `nano`? …where’s `man`?!) I finally have it up and running with current versions of my research tools. It feels so much smoother than trying to run things through Ubuntu so far, and I’m considering having my students with Windows laptops make use of it for my courses too (Octave and Sage for everyone!).\n\nAnd many thanks to all the folks who have contributed to the Arch Wiki. Pretty much all of my beginner questions had easy to find answers on the wiki, and the level of detail was perfect for someone who knows how to use basic terminal commands but not much else. \n\nNow I want to get a laptop to put Arch Linux on.

    "title": "2 years in and I finally feel somewhat knowledgable",
    "body": "So I had to nuke some harddrives (dealing with someone who got access to my google accounts, and potentially my computer(s), so had to go scorched earth on my setup.  Was painfully necessary unfortunately) and I had gotten more than a little lazy when it comes to security.  So when I started rebuilding my setup I installed Arch onto an encrypted thumbdrive and used BTRFS (BTRFS isn't the fastest solution for an operating system on a USB thumbdrive by the way) with separate subvolumes for the logs, var, home, and root folders.  This made for a great setup for snapshots, but I really wasn't considering the implications for when I eventually migrated from a thumbdrive to an SSD.\n\n  \nCut to a few days ago, I finally decide to buy a new NVME SSD for my laptop (I wasn't the only person hacked, and the authorities have been involved, so I'm fairly sure that this person won't be making any further moves moving forward, if I had to guess) and legitimize my Arch install.  I also wanted to get more space and speed things up--even with a barebones Arch install using Hyprland, the speed for random reads and writes is pretty abysmal, and I am usually doing development on my PC's these days.\n\n  \nSo I go to migrate my install and realize...this is a bit more complicated than a simple 'rsync -aHAXS /mnt/source /mnt/target'.  Having to recreate the filesystem, setup the encryption, copy all of the subvolumes, ensure that everything interacts with everything else correctly is a bit, well, intense, all things considered.\n\nHowever, after a day or so of transferring (good god usb thumbdrive's are slow.  Less than 1 million files and 220GB took literally 24 hours to fully copy) and a couple hours of setup, I unplugged my thumbdrive on reboot, sure I'd absolutely fucked up SOMETHING along the way but...\n\n  \nShe boots.  No problems, no missing anything, no hitches, everything in place.  Even my browser history and tmux settings are in tact.  Literally everything is there and everything works.  For the first time since I switched to Linux 2 years ago, I've successfully completed a somewhat complicated operation, with zero problems, zero issues, and zero caveats.\n\nI know in the grand scheme of things, this is somewhat minor.  But I just feel like I finally achieved some base level of competency in Linux that I'd spent decades at in Windows.  I did my first data migration when I was 12 years old in Windows, and while it's a bit simpler in an unencrypted Windows 98 installation than it is in pretty much any Arch Linux installation, still.  Just feels good.\n\n  \nAnyways, that's all I got.  Silly?  Sure.  But my foray into learning Linux started with Ubuntu (ugh) and, even though Arch is better, it's MUCH more intricate for doing things that matter.  I've only recently started using regex regularly, I picked up neovim finally a few months ago, and it took me almost a year to even try tmux.  Normally it wouldn't take this long, but the whole reason I began learning Linux was because I was getting into machine learning and trying to figure out how to utilize, make, and dissect LLMs and see what makes them tick--so it was buy a used Mac or install Linux.  Linux is/was the 'free' option, so that became my go-to.  I dual booted for a year, and only recently decided to go Arch only.  I finally feel comfortable editing config service files, and the only time I refer to documentation is when trying out new software.  I've learned how to use cmake/ninja/bazel/git (although I'm still somewhat novice with these, I can use them functionally), and I even branched out from Python to relearn some C++ and mess around with Zig.\n\n  \nI'm far from a guru, but I do like being competent, at the very least.  I need to learn more about the base programs/services that (most) Linux distributions ship with (like sed, grep, and others--I still just use grep for 'grep -r \"\\[search query\\] .\" and the like, ,or 'ps aux | grep' or 'lsmod | grep' etc etc; basic stuff), but I at least have a grasp on all of the different things that CAN be done.  From there it's just a quick --help or google search to figure out how to do what I want to do.\n\n  \nI dunno, it's just nice to have done all this myself, put the onus on myself to learn everything I have (I have had no job, school, or other outside influence on me to pick any of this up--in fact, I spent 90% of my free time playing competitive video games before all of this, so learning to program and to use Linux was more than a bit of a left turn all things considered), and it's beginning to pay off in some really rewarding ways.\n\n  \nP.S. setting up a tmux/bash script to display CPU/GPU/RAM/VRAM/DISK utilization in my status bar has been probably my favorite part of it all.  Customizing tmux is super fun, and keeping my eye on all of that hardware information keeps me from having to have htop/btop open in an adjacent pane while running various programs.\n\n  \nThanks for reading my blog /s",

I kept windows just in case I ever needed it but right now I don't think I need windows 11 anymore as I can't even remember the last time i booted into windows. So i am considering doing a full wipe and fresh arch installation. I have gone through manual installation but for convenience I am thinking of giving archinstall a try. What i need in my fresh installation are:\n\n1. encryption ( i never did disk encryption, i always sticked to arch installation wiki but I think encryption would be good moving forward ).\n\n2. Switch to systemd-boot from grub as i am moving away from dual boot. \n\n3. I used to use zram so there was no swap partition but later switched to zswap as I found out it was already enabled in Arch and used swapfile with btrfs recommended method. I plan to create a swap partition now and use zswap with it.\n\n4. I just want the minimal installation option, I will setup niri with my configs later as post installation.\n\nI used snapper with btrfs previously but it has been 4 years since my last arch installation. So, is archinstall good enough or should i invest a little time to know what's standard best practices are right now and go with manual installation for better results?\n\n\nEdit: \n\nI just went with archinstall script. Turns out, the script is pretty flexible and lets you skip part that you don't want it to do. I just let it handle the tedious part and did some manual work to make the installation customized to my interest. \n\nBut i do agree that it is not for new users. In my opinion, Arch should be installed in an opinionated way. If you are just going to install whatever recommended without much thought, using Arch will be same as using any other linux distribution. Linux comes with a lot of options and unlike other distribution, Arch lets you cherry pick each and every part of it. Take advantage of it when you can, use the wiki. \n\nArchinstall script is pretty good when you know what you are doing. ",

    "body": "This is for **Nvidia** users. I ran into an issue recently where my system would go back to sleep after waking. Really frustrating, but after traversing the journal and doing some poking, I found the solution and I figured I would share it for posterity.\n\nMaybe this is just super obvious for everyone, but (as a somewhat novice Arch user) it wasn't for me.\n\nSystem specs:\n\nKernel: **Linux 6.17.5-arch1-1**\n\nDE: **Gnome 49.1**\n\nWM: **Mutter (Wayland)**\n\nGPU: **Nvidia**\n\nDriver: **nvidia-dkms**\n\n\nVery simple fix. I found an older update to how systemd sleep worked, and it reads as such:\n\n&gt;The behavior of systemd-sleep and systemd-homed has been updated to freeze user sessions when entering the various sleep modes or when locking a homed-managed home area. This is known to cause issues with the proprietary NVIDIA drivers. Packagers of the NVIDIA proprietary drivers may want to add drop-in configuration files that set SYSTEMD\\_SLEEP\\_FREEZE\\_USER\\_SESSIONS=false for systemd-suspend.service and related services, and SYSTEMD\\_HOME\\_LOCK\\_FREEZE\\_SESSION=false for systemd-homed.service.\n\nSo.. I just set this to `TRUE` to prevent the race condition of some component settling or stray power event to retrigger the suspend again.\n\nI just edited the services `sudo systemctl edit` to prevent this against future updates:\n\n* systemd-suspend.service\n* systemd-hibernate.service\n* systemd-suspend-then-hibernate.service\n* systemd-hybrid-sleep.service\n\nI set what the template showed in those files, pasting in the appropriate area:\n\n    [Service]\n    Environment=SYSTEMD_SLEEP_FREEZE_USER_SESSIONS=1\n\nAnd now my system operates normally not going back to sleep after waking. Hopefully this helps somebody with the same issue. Maybe there is a better way to go about this, and maybe this wont work for everyone - I am definitely open to adjusting my logic here and seeing what I could do differently.\n\n**Edit:** So this works persistently. But, I found an edge case where even with this fix, I still have the system going back to sleep quickly after a wake. I think I’ve narrowed it down to application noise (in my specific case, I think it’s something to do with Spotify).\n\nAs soon as I zero in on the issue - as I am not sure if it’s specific to Nvidia, Wayland, gnome or something else, I’m going to do a write up on the fix and link the post here.\n\nIf you’re coming across this post, and your issue is _a blank screen on wake_, then this post is not covering a fix for that.

I'm about to have a mental breakdown over this.\n\n​I've been trying to get a stable Arch install on my laptop for months. I've reinstalled this thing 10-12 times. Whenever I use ext4, it's pretty stable. But I wanted to do things the \"right\" way with Btrfs and Snapper for snapshots.\n\n​Every. Fucking. Time. I use Btrfs, I get random hard system freezes. The screen just locks, audio stops, and I have to hard reboot. The logs (journalctl -b -1) show nothing. They just stop at the time of the freeze.\n\n​I've been working day and night trying to fix this. I feel like I'm losing my mind. The time and stress I've put into this is uncountable.\n\n​Here is my hardware:\n​Laptop: ASUS ROG STRIX G513RC\n\n​CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 6800H with Radeon Graphics\n\n​GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3050 Mobile\n\n​RAM: 16GB DDR5\n\n​Disk: Micron NVMe SSD\n\n​Here is EVERYTHING I have done to try and fix this.\n\n​Suspected the Kernel: Thought the standard linux kernel was the problem.\n\n​Action: Switched to linux-lts and nvidia-lts.\n​Result: Still froze.\n\n​Suspected Drivers/Config:\n​Action: Fixed my GRUB config to actually boot the LTS kernel (it wasn't). Set it as the default (GRUB_DEFAULT=0).\n\n​Action: Updated /etc/mkinitcpio.conf to load all graphics drivers (amdgpu, nvidia, nvidia_drm) in the initramfs for early KMS.\n​Result: It looked cleaner, but it still fucking froze.\n\n​Suspected the Btrfs Swap File: This seemed like the \"smoking gun.\"\n​Action: I checked /etc/fstab and my Btrfs swap subvolume was missing nodatacow. I added it, turned swap off, remounted, and turned it back on. I verified with mount | grep /swap that nodatacow was active.\n\n​Result: I was so happy. I thought it was solved. IT STILL FUCKING FROZE.\n\n​Suspected the Hardware (Disk):\n​Action: Installed smartmontools and ran sudo smartctl -a on my NVMe.\n\n​Result: PASSED. The drive is 100% healthy. 0 errors, 100% available spare.\n\n​Suspected the BIOS/Firmware: I saw some ACPI BIOS Error (bug) messages on boot.\n​Action: Went to the ASUS support site for my G513RC.\n\n​Result: My BIOS is already on the latest version.\n\n​Suspected the Hardware (RAM): This was the final boss. I was told Btrfs is heavy on RAM and could be hitting a bad cell that ext4 never touched. I was sure this was it.\n\n​Action: Made a bootable Memtest86+ USB. I let it run.\n\n​Result: Pass: 1, Errors: 0. My RAM is perfectly, 100% fine.\n\n​So now what?\n\n​I'm just tired, dude. I've proven it's not the kernel. It's not the drivers. It's not the swap file config. It's not the disk. It's not the BIOS. And it's not the RAM.\n\n​The only goddamn variable left is Btrfs itself.\n​I'm a beginner, but I did all the \"professional\" steps. I'm just trying to have a stable system with snapshots. Is that too much to ask?\n​Is Btrfs just cursed on some hardware? Is this a known issue with my ASUS laptop or this Ryzen CPU? Am I missing anything?\n\n​I'm 100% ready to just say \"fuck Btrfs\" and go back to my stable ext4 install. Please, any suggestions from you pros? I'm desperate.\n\n​Arch on Btrfs hard-freezes. Already fixed nodatacow swap, on LTS kernel, smartctl passed, BIOS is updated, and Memtest86+ passed with 0 errors. I'm out of ideas. Is ext4 my only hope?\n\nEDIT / SOLVED:\n\nSystem is finally stable now — no more random freezes or shutdowns.\n\nThe issue was caused by having a swap file on the same Btrfs partition that used compression (compress=zstd:3).\nWhen RAM filled up, the kernel tried to compress swap data, which caused instant system freezes with no logs or errors.\n\nFix:\n\nBooted into GParted\n\nShrunk main Btrfs partition\n\nCreated a new 16 GB dedicated Linux-swap partition\n\nAdded its UUID to /etc/fstab\n\n\nAlso switched to the LTS kernel and replaced discard=async with fstrim.timer.\n\nTip for others:\nIf you face random freezes on Btrfs, don’t use a swap file on a compressed partition.\nCreate a proper swap partition instead — it fixes the problem completely.",

If someone has one of those cards and has installed the proprietary Nvidia driver, what happens when the new driver is released and a person updates their system through pacman? I can’t see any way that pacman would know not to update the driver. I do see that drivers for older architectures are included in AUR. Can a package be “frozen” so it doesn’t update and then allow for an admin to switch to the AUR package before a system update causes a system breakage?",

In that vain, I've found that once these packages are updated, the issue returns - they are:  \nalsa-lib-1.2.14-2  graphviz-14.0.2-1  lib32-alsa-lib-1.2.14-2  lib32-libdrm-2.4.127-1

This is useful after a large file copy. Disk write cache and swap both stay full and the system actually slows down. i don't know why Linux doesn't automatically release this memory after a large file copy is complete. But it doesn't for whatever reason. This set of commands dumps the cache and reclaims that memory. It gives the computer a bit of a boost. It's quite noticeable on lower end hardware.\n\nTrim: trims all volumes.\n\nupdate: updates repo packages and aur packages, the default behavior for paccache is to keep the last three packages in cache and clear the rest. I do this to save disk space. I can always roll back beyond that with the downgrade tool if need be. Updates snap and flatpaks. I don't' have any snaps installed. But i have that in the command just in case i ever do.\n\nInstall / remove: pretty obvious what those do.\n\nfind: searches the repo and aur for packages.\n\nbuild: tells it to build an AUR package\n\nClean: displays orphaned packages from both pacman and yay and prompts you to remove them.\n\nOrphans: only list the orphans, does not remove them.\n\nRank: uses reflector to search for and rank mirrors. \n\nAnyways. that's what i got.

Unfortunately, I had to switch to Windows for work — and after about five or six years of it, I’ve had enough. I really miss my Arch + Hyprland setup and would love to go back.\n\nSo, has anyone figured out a good workflow for this?

    "body": "I have been using some version of Linux as my daily driver for more than two years now. For just over a year, it's been Garuda Linux. I left Windows mostly because I really am over the privacy issues with Windows 11 and I also detest being treated like a recurring revenue stream on an operating system I paid full price for. \n\nI gave my old gaming desktop to my kids to play games on the TV with and it still runs Windows 11. The kids mostly play games on Steam family accounts.\n\nI'm pretty sure at this point they won't care what operating system the gaming desktop uses. They care that they can play their games. So I'm down to two issues preventing the swap to Linux for the kids.\n\nIssue #1: We have a Quest 3 that the kids and I use infrequently. Getting it to work at all in Linux proved to be an exceptionally painful experience. I had varying levels of success with different online tutorials and it took several hours to get through that. When I did finally get the Quest 3 to work, it was still an inferior experience to Steam VR and Windows Mixed Reality, requiring sometimes significant tweaks to be able to interact with the game at all. For the moment, this is one isn't the end of the world. A lot of the stuff we play with Steam VR can be played natively on the headset though this does have the disadvantage of severely decreasing the headset's battery life.\n\n  \nIssue #2: Game controller support appears to be spotty. It could be the controllers. I purchased relatively cheap controllers from Gamesir. That way, if\\\\when the kids busted one, either through just not knowing how to take care of a game controller or via sudden rage induced mechanical failure, it wouldn't be that big of a deal. The problem we've run into is that getting more than two controllers working at the same time appears to be some combination of chanting the correct incantation and only using them during specific planetary alignments of Jupiter and Mars. Essentially, we can usually get two working reliably but a 3rd is asking a lot. It's not an issue we had with the same controllers on the same games in Windows 11. I'm open to the idea that the cheap controllers just won't work well in Linux and as my kids are a bit older now(13, 12, 9), I'd be willing to invest in some better quality controllers if I knew they'd work well with Linux.\n\nAny thoughts on the above? I'd love to ditch Windows entirely but I do understand that most manufacturers of hardware and software still develop primarily for Windows.  \n",

Used the CTT debloat tool to transform a bloated, telemetry collecting win11 iso to an incredibly minimal windows iso and installed it onto winboat + ran the ctt debloat tool AGAIN to kill all the shitty windows services no one asked for.... Installed fl studio and now need a way to access my sounds within the VM without giving windows access to the home folder :D\n\n\n\n\n\nI've decided to switch to arch linux. As a complete beginner I understand that this is a risky move, but I desire to learn and grow through this journey.\n\nI had to leave behind windows because i couldn't make a partition big enough for my linux endeavor, so I decided to just install arch on the whole drive: I used archinstall, encrypted the ssd and I'm using the hardened linux kernel bc I'd like to bring some privacy and digital security back into my life (i did install and activate a firewall too).\n\nNow, I bought and I've been using Fl Studio for quite some time and after looking at a couple of wine tutorials, specific for this topic, I thought I could get it working. I did get it to work somewhat, but got quite a few errors and unfortunately don't have an audio interface compatible with linux.\n\nMy 2 main questions are:\n\n1. Is it possible to get it working, perhaps using a solution like \"bottles\" and routing my audio properly using carla (or something a bit more intuitive) in a way that works?\n2. would it be a viable option to dualboot windows on the same encrypted ssd without having to start over from scratch (which I wouldn't mind too much)?\n\nI'll provide some extra information if needed and any help would be highly appreciated...\n\nSome extra info I feel might be useful for you to know: running kde plasma 6, i set up timeshift on this partition using RSYNC, BTRFC file structure...\n\nI set it all up today so I will take all recommendations into consideration and I'm willing to start fresh and vanilla arch is not a must as long as I'm able to customize everything and make music :)\n\nThank you so unbelievably much in advance and whether you help me or are just passing by, thank you for existing!",

And then during the process it knocked me out of my X session and every log in attempt my screen would blink for half a second and I would be back in my login screen. I shut my laptop down and turned it back on, and I got an error message about modules.devname not found in /lib/\"xxx\"/arch and I was left in a terminal with my name replaced with rootfs. None of the commands would work like nvim or pacman, and I honestly have no idea what that error was so please let me know if you guys know what that means. I'm just gonna talk about how I got back into arch and how I'm making this post.\n\nFirst, I wiped the dust off my usb stick and got back into the live environment. I mounted my partitions with the mount command, and entered my system through arch-chroot.\n\nThen, I reinstalled grub. Apparently that's how somebody else solved this issue back in 2018 so I thought I would give it a try. I ran grub-install pointing to my boot partition and efi directory, and remade my config with grub-mkconfig. All of this went with no errors. I rebooted the system and now my Arch Linux entry was gone.\n\nSo I chrooted back into my system and used efibootmgr to remove all the useless entries and made a new entry pointing to my new grubx64.efi. It was located in /boot/EFI/EFI/GRUB for some reason. If anybody knows whether it's fine to have two EFI folders or if I should be concerned for the future please let me know also.\n\nAnd I rebooted, and everything was working fine and normal again. So basically the solution was to reinstall grub, remake the config, use efibootmgr to make sure my system finds arch\n\nHopefully if anybody else runs into the same problem as me it helps a little bit.",

    "title": "My Arch Journey ~ A Linux Newbie",
    "body": "# Preface\n\nI have never ever tried Arch before, and I am dying to express my journey to *somebody.*  \nTurns out, people get bored incredibly quickly when I start talking about arch :)\n\nSo this might be a slightly long post, please bear with me. Hope this might in someway help someone.\n\n# Chapter 1 - First Install\n\nFrom what I have heard the one and only guide for installation you need is [\"The Wiki\"](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide)\n\nI have read a lot of documentations, none of them as \"complete\" as this one. It has everything that one might ever need. It just needs to be searched thoroughly.\n\nI installed an extremely basic installation but I got lost on what packages to install. Getting confused with what a DE is what SDDM does and so on.\n\nI wanted to just get some sort of a setup started so I followed [this](https://gist.github.com/mjkstra/96ce7a5689d753e7a6bdd92cdc169bae)\n\nI have never worked with btrfs file system. But I thought I'll give it a shot. The author mentions that we need to create sub volumes of @ and @ home. (Which I completely ignored because I thought it wasn't important and went ahead with my 2 separate partitions for each)\n\nBIG MISTAKE\n\n# Chapter 2 - Timeshift\n\nSo now I got the hang of Arch,\n\n* Installed KDE, downloaded themes mix and matched stuff\n* Installed a theme for my GRUB\n   * (Also modified it using grub-customizer by removing unecessary entries and re-ordering other entries (Linux Mint &amp; Windows). Another mistake BTW.\n* Setup few other packages that I require and was quite happy with my setup.\n\nNow, I wanted to save it. The github author of the installation guide suggested timeshift worked amazing with btrfs. So I wanted to try timeshift!\n\nTurns out, you *require* @ and @ home directories since that is the setup timeshift expects (for reasons unknown)\n\nThe Fix:  \nI won't go into too many details but basically,\n\n1. Created a copy of my root partition in \"@\" via the btrfs snapshot feature.\n2. Created a new subvolume \"@ home\" and copied my home partition into it (Please note to use `cp -rp` . Don't ask how I know)\n3. Generated my fstab file again (Please note to remove previous entries in the file and not just use the `&gt;&gt;` as mentioned in the wiki. Again, don't ask.)\n4. Generate the grub.cfg file again (And as much as I liked grub-customizer earlier. I HATED it here. It does something to the files which kind of break the generation of grub.cfg, it does not go to the vanilla configuration. Please note, just manually modify the grub.cfg for your OCD instead of messing with grub-customizer IMO)\n5. Finally, system was booting and mounted correctly, I still had my complete setup. Now I just cleaned the rest of the stuff up by deleting the previous locations of the root and home directory (gparted is pretty cool too!)\n\nPhew,\n\n# Chapter 3 - Nvidia\n\nNow, the only problem that I was having with my setup (now that it was completely backed up), was that I could only run 60Hz on my monitor. From most inferences I see online, it seems that installing nvidia drivers seems to have resolved the problem.\n\nLet me just begin this by saying thank god I figured out timeshift earlier. So that I can make instant undos / redos here!\n\n# Chapter 3.1 - ???\n\nThat's a wiki reference for you all (the 3.1 get it?). Anyways so I started here: [https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA)\n\nNow I think I'll get some backlash for this, but to my untrained eye, this is THE most confusing of the Arch Wiki pages I have seen. (Totally didn't start reading Arch Wiki like a week back \\\\s)\n\nI got to the first step and installed nvidia-open and the later steps just confused the heck out of me. From what I could understand, I had to install the package nvidia-open and somehow set modeset=1 somewhere. I tried understanding the page for half an hour when I gaveup and just rebooted my system.\n\nTo my surprise, my monitor started working at 120 Hz right away! Big win right there.\n\n# Chapter 3.2 - The reboot\n\nI shutdown my system, came back a day later only to see that SDDM had not even loaded.  \n(BTW another note: ctrl + alt + f3 lets you login via TTY3)\n\nI saw the `journalctl -b` and saw some log saying \"nvidia-gpu i2c timeout error\". Still no idea what it means.\n\nI tried the following to fix:\n\n* upgraded all packages\n* Downgraded nvidia-open and nvidia-utils (Another note: You can use the downgrade package to downgrade stuff. Also note, you can specify multiple packages in a single downgrade command to simultaneously downgrade packagase that depend on each other)\n* Installed nvidia-exec (nvx). It did solve the problem by shutting down my nvidia gpu entirely so that the system runs on my integrated card. But that is hardly a solution (this time I couldn't even start the screen of my monitor with the integrated gpu)\n\nAnyway, nothing worked, until I stumbled upon this page:\n\n[https://forum.manjaro.org/t/how-to-add-nvidia-drm-modeset-1-kernel-parameter/152447](https://forum.manjaro.org/t/how-to-add-nvidia-drm-modeset-1-kernel-parameter/152447)\n\nWhere the user \"nikgnomic\" kindly \"spelled out\" how to set the modeset=1.\n\n# Chapter 3.3 - Sigh\n\nI thought it worked. However, just when I was opening my laptop to write this post, it happened again. Sometimes rebooting fixes the issue, still not sure about the cause of the problem though.\n\nPlease share any things I can try here.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis is the BEST experience of linux I have had ever. I am not sure why. Perhaps it is because I built it myself or maybe because of how much I got to learn along the way. I had tons of fun!\n\nI would highly recommend anyone who is somewhat familiar with Linux or has the time to learn and read to install Arch.\n\nLook forward to being part of the Arch community!\n\nLife update (5 Nov):\n\nI finally got Nvidia to work!! wohoo. Turns out, early loading of the nvidia modules is a must. Oh well, the more you know.",

So am the tech, my friend in Vermont calls me last night frantic cause his PC Arch just got messed up and doesn't know how to even begin to reinstall.\n\nI start talking to chatgpt.. yes chatgpt.. and it gave me an idea for him to open a port on his router so I can ssh to him on the usb live Arch installation. He doesn't have access to the router.. so chatgpt tells me to do reverse ssh, let him connect to me and then I can connect to him..\n\nSo to conclude this story, I don't know what F***$&amp;$ry of magic I pulled out of my A*&amp;!! But I was able to install Linux on his machine, from South Florida to Vermont or Connecticut some where up north 3 hours from Boston... partition and all and got him up and running, In like 30mins, with setting up the reverse ssh..\n\nWe both were screaming on the phone and the wives were like what is up with you guys.. and we were like: OMG!!!!OMG!! OMG!!\n\nI love this OS and the roller coaster of learning experience I have learned in the past 2 years, Microsoft can't get me back even if they payed me.. even my son yesterday after what he saw wiped his windows is and install cachyos and got all his games up and running..\n\nThis for me as of yesterday had turned into the god tier OS... the more I learn, the better it gets.. everyone I have helped is grateful.. everything just works!! Linux is one truly awesome OS.. \n\nYear 1 was learning year, you will mess up, but instead of feeling defeated learn from that moment, it's growing pains.. MS has brain washed us to believe that the issues it has is normal.. OS tweaks and it's not... In Linux you will also learn, cause that is what we do learn in life.. And once it clicks..

The reason I am asking for help here, is because I know that certain nvidia drivers are tied directly to the kernel versions, and a mismatch can result in even bigger problems.\n\nHow can I accurately downgrade my nvidia module from 580.105.08 to 580.95.05?\n\nI am aware I can use the `downgrade` tool, but what modules specifically need to be targeted (lib-\\*, nvidia-\\*, etc)? Does it have to be every single one, or just a few specific modules? Would I also need to downgrade my kernel, or can it stay the same (as there were no ABI changes in the recent update)?\n\nI am assuming it is just `lib32-nvidia-utils` (580.105.08), `libva-nvidia-driver` (0.0.14 - irrelevant?), `linux-firmware-nvidia` (20251021-1 - irrelevant?), `nvidia-dkms` (580.105.08), `nvidia-settings` (580.105.08), `nvidia-utils` (580.105.08).\n\nThank you.",

    "body": "I was very interested to see what performs best in games, regardless of Wayland or X11\n\nSo, I tried Cinnamon first, and honestly had probably the worst latency in games, I play competitive shooters, and I was playing Source Engine title to see how it is, since I know how it feels so well on Windows 11 too.\n\nInterestingly enough Cinnamon in Arch does not feel as responsive as Cinnamon in Linux Mint I had installed before\n\nThen I tried Gnome, although Arch performs moderately good in Gnome at the desktop level, gaming itself feels a bit sluggish, but less so than Cinnamon. I even tried Cinnamon Wayland, but sluggish behavior was still there. I tried Gnome X11 and Gnome Wayland, both performed good at desktop level, but slow in games. It felt like I was constantly behind in mouse response.\n\nI then proceeded to move to XFCE to test how it was after Gnome, and XFCE on X11 is the best I have tried\n\nResponsiveness is truly the best out of DEs that I tried, mouse feels very responsive to clicks in games and movement feels very good\n\nSeeing XFCE perform so well definitely surprised me, but what surprised me more is that Cinnamon integration into Arch is simply worse than Linux Mint integration of Cinnamon.\n\nI would say Linux Mint Cinnamon is on par with Arch Gnome, but Linux Mint Cinnamon still beats out Arch Gnome in responsiveness of games, and overall smoothness.\n\nAnother issue I have encountered with Cinnamon in Arch is that restarting PC and trying to get into Steam would result into an issue getting into Steam. Although, it was working a restart prior. No matter how much I tried to reinstall Steam, the issue remained.\n\nI would say in some cases (perhaps hardware based) Cinnamon is not integrating well with Arch, at least for me. There is definitely a visual stutter and sluggishness with Cinnamon for me. Cinnamon was solo installed on Arch by me as native DE.\n\nThen I proceeded to install the rest of DEs manually\n\nI am not a huge chaser of frames per second, as much as smoothness and frame pacing, and XFCE is amazing with Arch for gaming.\n\nInteresting enough for me was the fact that for some people Cinnamon runs flawlessly with Arch, but not with my hardware.\n\nInterestingly enough Linux Mint holds it's own with Cinnamon with that Ubuntu base\n\nArch is cool, you can install basically any DE at your fingertips with a command, but mileage definitely varies depending on hardware. I expected Cinnamon to perform just as reliable as Mint, but on Arch, but it wasn't the case. I really like Cinnamon visually and functionally, but I will stick to Linux Mint if I was to use Cinnamon.\n\nAs a side note I turned off compositor for all of these DEs to keep the latency as low as possible.\n\nIf anyone truly wants to test the best DE for your system, I really suggest installing one DE, and then installing all the ones you want to try on top of the OS, and switch to each while at the login screen. Then find the best one and uninstall the other instances\n\nResults may vary, and in my case the drastic difference was likely tied to my hardware more than DE or Arch itself.",

    "body": "EDIT: If you're using disk encryption and switching to a systemd-based ramdisk, you need to change your kernel boot parameters. What worked for me was to replace cryptdevice=UUID=*uuid-1234*:root with rd.luks.name=*uuid-1234*=root in /etc/default/grub and run grub-mkconfig.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday I updated mkinitcpio to version 40, and pacman added a new config file. I merged it with pacdiff and ran `mkinitcpio -P`. After that I rebooted and GRUB was stuck at \"loading initial ramdisk\" stage for what I think was a couple minutes. I then got an error saying that it timed out waiting for my disk device.\n\nAnyway, I have then spent the next hour troubleshooting, and it turned out that I forgot to add the `sd-encrypt` hook. However, that still did not fix my problem, and I'm really not sure what's wrong. I've rebuilt my initramfs with an old config and it works fine.\n\nOld hooks: `HOOKS=(base udev autodetect microcode modconf kms keyboard keymap consolefont block encrypt filesystems fsck)`  \nNew hooks: `HOOKS=(base systemd autodetect microcode modconf kms keyboard sd-vconsole sd-encrypt block filesystems fsck)`  \nEverything else is the same.\n\nAdditional information: I use btrfs with an encrypted root partition and unencrypted boot partition.

I used to use MusicBee, that would transfer music files based on their rating (i.e. my favourite music) to my phone and would also delete songs, that are not in the playlist anymore.\nI am still lacking a way to do this on Linux.\nI tried to get this working with rsync\n($ rsync -arv --delete --delete-missing-args --files-from=&lt;(grep -v '^#' /SOME/PATH/Playlist.m3u) /PATH/TO/MUSIC/ /home/USER/destination/)\nand could achieve that the music got copied to the destination folder. However, files that i randomly copied in the destination folder for testing would not get deleted however i altered the command. Rsync would just ignore the files that i copied there myself.\n\nSo, does anyone have an idea how i could get this working?\nMaybe i could build a script that creates symlinks for each music file in a temp folder that then gets synchronized via rsync or FreeFileSync? Or is there a way to do this with SyncThing?\n\nOne more thing, my favourites-playlist consists of &gt;1500 files, so just nuking all music on my phone and then copying everything takes roughly 60 minutes. Not ideal for just adding a few new songs every few days.\n\nIn an ideal world i would like to have a script that scans my music library for files based on a 5* rating (ratings on Linux are weird...) and would sync them to my phone.\n\nThank you so much for your help!\n",

This is my first time using Btrfs (always been on ext4), so I'd appreciate any feedback on my setup to make sure I'm following best practices.\n\n# My Setup\n\n**Hardware/Disk Layout:**\n\n* **Disk 1 (sda - 60GB):** System disk\n   * sda1: 2GB /boot partition (FAT32)\n   * sda2: 58GB LUKS encrypted partition (cryptlvm)\n* **sda2**:  on LUKS with two logical volumes:\n   * vg1-root: 23.2GB (Btrfs)\n   * vg1-home: 34.8GB (Btrfs)\n* **Disk 2 (sdb - 10GB):** Data disk\n   * LUKS encrypted, no LVM (named cryptlvm2 despite no LVM!)\n   * Single Btrfs filesystem mounted at /mnt/Data\n* **Boot manager:** rEFInd\n\n**Subvolume Layout for LVs:**\n\n    vg1-root (Btrfs):\n      @           -&gt; /\n      @var        -&gt; /var\n      @tmp        -&gt; /tmp\n      @swap       -&gt; /swap (contains swapfile)\n      \n    vg1-home (Btrfs):\n      @home           -&gt; /home\n      @home_snapshots -&gt; /home/.snapshots\n\nI used `snapper` to set up automatic snapshots of the root partition. It created a .snapshot subvolume.\n\n**Current fstab:**\n\n    # vg1-root subvolumes\n    UUID=debbb9c9-0a1e-4ce0-b776-bf9542051a56  /            btrfs  rw,relatime,compress=zstd:3,space_cache=v2,subvol=/@      0 0\n    UUID=debbb9c9-0a1e-4ce0-b776-bf9542051a56  /.snapshots  btrfs  rw,relatime,compress=zstd:3,space_cache=v2,subvolid=5    0 0\n    UUID=debbb9c9-0a1e-4ce0-b776-bf9542051a56  /var         btrfs  rw,relatime,compress=zstd:3,space_cache=v2,subvol=/@var  0 0\n    UUID=debbb9c9-0a1e-4ce0-b776-bf9542051a56  /tmp         btrfs  rw,relatime,compress=zstd:3,space_cache=v2,subvol=/@tmp  0 0\n    UUID=debbb9c9-0a1e-4ce0-b776-bf9542051a56  /swap        btrfs  rw,relatime,compress=zstd:3,space_cache=v2,subvol=/@swap 0 0\n    \n    # vg1-home subvolumes\n    UUID=01c77df7-acc9-496d-a9d5-938ff0e503de  /home            btrfs  rw,relatime,compress=zstd:3,space_cache=v2,subvol=/@home            0 0\n    UUID=01c77df7-acc9-496d-a9d5-938ff0e503de  /home/.snapshots btrfs  rw,relatime,compress=zstd:3,space_cache=v2,subvol=/@home_snapshots  0 0\n    \n    # Other mounts\n    UUID=F0AB-E52E  /boot      vfat   rw,relatime,fmask=0022,dmask=0022,codepage=437,iocharset=ascii,shortname=mixed,utf8,errors=remount-ro  0 2\n    UUID=7274efbe-fbcb-470f-a5c0-ef425c3dd719  /mnt/Data  btrfs  defaults,relatime,compress=zstd,nosuid,nodev,nofail,x-gvfs-show,x-gvfs-name=Data  0 2\n    /swap/swapfile  none  swap  defaults  0 0\n\n`lsblk` output:\n\n    NAME           MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE  MOUNTPOINTS\n    sda              8:0    0   60G  0 disk\n    ├─sda1           8:1    0    2G  0 part  /boot\n    └─sda2           8:2    0   58G  0 part\n      └─cryptlvm   253:0    0   58G  0 crypt\n        ├─vg1-root 253:1    0 23.2G  0 lvm   /.snapshots\n        │                                    /var\n        │                                    /tmp\n        │                                    /swap\n        │                                    /\n        └─vg1-home 253:2    0 34.8G  0 lvm   /home/.snapshots\n                                             /home\n    sdb              8:16   0   10G  0 disk\n    └─cryptlvm2    253:3    0   10G  0 crypt /mnt/Data\n\n# My Questions\n\n1. Do I actually need to mount the .snapshots subvolume?\n2. Is the `subvolid=5` mount for /.snapshots correct? Snapper created the snapshots but didn't auto-generate the fstab entry. I manually added it with `subvolid=5` (mount the top-level Btrfs volume) to allow proper rollbacks without losing snapshot history. Is this the right approach? I tried using `subvol=.snapshots,` `subvol=/@.snapshots,` and `subvol=@.snapshots. However,`they all failed. How should I add the fstab entry properly?\n3. What's the standard subvolume structure? I separated `/var`, `/tmp`, and `/swap` into their own subvolumes to exclude them from root snapshots. Should I also separate `/var/log` and `/var/cache`, or is just `/var` sufficient? What do most people use?\n4. Separate home on different LVM volume - good or bad? I put `/home` on a separate LVM partition for flexibility (The same structure as my current ext4-based system). Does this cause any issues with Btrfs features or snapshots? Is it OK?\n5. Mount options - anything missing? I'm using `compress=zstd:3`, `space_cache=v2`, and `relatime`. Should I add `noatime` or any SSD-specific options like `discard=async`? I have enabled fstrim.service on my system.\n6. Any good blogs/guides for this setup? I've been piecing this together from the Arch Wiki, Claude, and various other sources. Anyone knows a comprehensive guide for Btrfs + Snapper + LVM + LUKS on Arch?\n\n# What Works So Far\n\n* Snapper is creating automatic snapshots successfully.\n* All subvolumes mount correctly on boot.\n* System seems stable.\n* Planning to use refind-btrfs to add snapshot boot entries to rEFInd (though the aur package seems old and unmaintained).\n\nI'd really appreciate any feedback, especially from folks experienced with Btrfs and Snapper. Are there any gotchas I should watch out for or improvements I should make?\n\n**P.S.** The second disk (sdb) automatically unlocks after the first disk using crypttab with a keyfile - pretty convenient for multi-disk LUKS setups!",

I want to hear my phone’s audio on my PC so I can listen to audiobooks while doing stuff on my pc \\[mostly gaming in this case\\]. I need the phone app specifically because I also listen during my long commute, so switching to a separate audiobook player \\[and yes I know cozy and it's nice\\] isn’t an option.\n\nWhat I’m trying to find is basically any way to get my phone’s audio onto my PC wirelessly with low latency whether that’s a proper audio-streaming method, some trick to make wireless ADB actually survive a phone reboot so I don’t have to crawl under my desk every time, or even some PipeWire/ADB/Wi-Fi workaround that isn’t laggy.  \n\n\nI tried scrcpy and it works, but I have to reconnect via USB ADB every time the phone restarts, because my PC’s USB ports are hard to reach. The whole replug USB to re-authenticate ADB step gets annoying fast.\n\nmy network setup: My phone is my hotspot. The hotspot connects to a Wi-Fi repeater. My PC connects to the repeater via ethernet cable.\n\n  \nnote: yes I know changing the listing time manually btween phone and pc is a choice, but I'm lazy and in CS, I will freaking make an app if I had too. I'm too lazy to do the same thingy over and over again and want to automate it if possible I have shell script that kinda does that with wifi debugging but my phone stops using the repeaters' network randomly \\[no internet\\].\n\n  \nsorry if my writing seems like a mess RN it's the ADHD lol.",

The only difference is that I formatted my root partition in BTRFS instead of Ext4.\n\nI followed all the instructions but when it came to setup grub, it told me that modinfo.sh doesn't exist. And when trying another bootloader efibootmgr it told be it couldn't find my EFI partition.\n\nI already tried several times and read all I could find on the subject but I don't get it.\n\nCould you explain to me what does that part with mount and chroot actually does?\n Why did I have to create a directory for /boot and not for /mnt ? I'm sure that the issue comes from that part since it's the part that is still obscure to me...\n\nThank you\n\nEdit: thank you everyone. I understand the command a little better. Still doesn't know why it doesn't work for me but it's just a matter of time before I figure it out...",

    "body": "Virtual sinks (filter-chains) don't restore their saved volume until audio plays. Fixed with a simple systemd service that triggers state restoration at boot.(kind of a hack)\n\nI set up an equalizer using libpipewire-module-filter-chain in PipeWire. It works great, but every time I reboot, the volume resets to 100% instead of what I had before.\nIf I adjust the volume before any audio plays with my wpctl -2% keybind, it takes the 100% state and sets it to 98%. If I play any  audio before executing a wpctl set-volume command, the correct volume loads.\n\nAfter digging through WirePlumber's state files, I found that:\n\nWirePlumber does save virtual sink volumes in ~/.local/state/wireplumber/stream-properties.\nBut it only restores them when a stream connects to the sink\nUntil then, the sink shows 100% volume (uninitialized state)\nAny volume adjustments before the first audio stream overwrites your saved state.\n\nThis is because WirePlumber treats filter-chain sinks like application streams (which activate on-demand) rather than like physical devices (which restore state immediately). It also does not restore mute state for some reason and starts unmuted.\n\nThe Solutions\n\nOption 1: node.always-process = true\nAdded to filter-chain.conf capture.props:\n\n    node.always-process = true\n\nSimple but I found it uses CPU processing silence.\n\nOption 2: \n\nSystemd service: \n\nCreate ~/.config/systemd/user/pipewire-sink-init.service:\n    \n    [Unit]\n    Description=Initialize virtual sink volume\n    After=wireplumber.service\n\n    [Service]\n    Type=oneshot\n    ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 2\n    ExecStart=/bin/sh -c 'pw-link internal_speaker:monitor_FL internal_speaker:playback_FL; pw-link internal_speaker:monitor_FR internal_speaker:playback_FR; sleep 0.1; pw-link -d internal_speaker:monitor_FL internal_speaker:playback_FL; pw-link -d internal_speaker:monitor_FR internal_speaker:playback_FR || true'\n\n    [Install]\n    WantedBy=default.target\n    \n\nWith this I manually create the links (which is what probably happens when a client connects) and destroy them so it can idle correctly.\n\nDo you think I should report this issue upstream? System-wide EQ is a necessity for me because the default tuning of the speaker causes excessive clipping above 50% volume, my EQ makes it very closely match the output of Windows. \n\nSystem Info:\n\nPipewire version: 1.4.9\n\nWireplumber version 0.5.12",

The system was barely usable.\n\nBoth monitors theoretically had the same refresh rate, but whilst my old monitor was **165Hz**, the new one was **164.96Hz**. It was my understanding that this didn't matter, and it was just something to do with the way it was calculated, but it seemed obvious to me that the system considered the monitors to have different refresh rates, which is why it had this stuttering, and nothing I tried helped.\n\nI messed around in nvidia-settings for ages based on what I found when searching for similar issues, but nothing made any difference.\n\nI read that Wayland supported monitors with different refresh rates, so I switched from X11 to Wayland, and it became extremely smooth. It was perfect, and the UFO test looked amazing.\n\nSo my question is: is it possible that a 0.04Hz difference in refresh rate is considered to be different refresh rates? Is it actually different? And is there any way for me to use X11 now or will I be Wayland-only from now on?",

    "body": "TLDR:  \nProblem: Cannot mount ext4 root partition to /mnt  \nSolution: Instead of ext4, format the root partition to btrfs with `mkfs.btrfs`\n\nHi, I'm fairly new to Arch. I had weeks worth of experience with another arch-based distro, though I think I still know very little about arch itself.\n\nAs the title suggests, I'm doing a manual installation of arch. I'm following the wiki, and currently in the *1.11. Mount File Systems* step. I have already created the partitions using cfdisk, none of them returned an error. However, when trying to mount my root partition\n\n`# mount /dev/sdb3 mnt`\n\nI get the following error:\n\n    EXT4-fs (sdb3): Could not load journal inode\n    mount: /mnt: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb3, missing codepage or helper program, or other error. dmesg(1) may have more information after failed mount system call\n\nI tried running `dmesg` , which I'm not familiar with, and got a bunch off lines that seem to be the system's logs for my session of installation. At the end, there are a few repeating entries saying:\n\n    Alternate GPT is invalid, using primary GPT\n    sdb: sdb1 sdb2 sdb3\n    JBD2: no valid journal superblock found\n    EXT4-fs (sdb3): Could not load journal inode\n\nAnd those last two lines with JBD2 and EXT4-fs are printed 7x more.\n\nI tried mounting my EFI partition to /mnt/boot, which was a success. Now I don't know why my ext4 root partition is not mounting, returning the errors I've mentioned above.\n\nIf I missed something please let me know. If you need some more info, lmk. Thank you in advance :)\n\n**UPDATE**: I tried formatting the partition into an ext3 filesystem instead of ext4. Then, I mounted it and... it worked? Though it returned this error:\n\n    EXT4-fs error (device sdb3): ext4_mb_generate_buddy:1212: group XXX, block bitmap and bg descriptor inconsistent: 0 vs 32255 free clusters\n\nAnd it's not just one line of that error. It returned a bunch, I think 5. \"group XXX\" also has XXX as different numbers for every iteration of this error.\n\nAfter this, I ran lsblk -f and found that the root partition, /sdb3 is now mounted. Though I'm afraid this could lead to potential issues down the road if I just ignore the error I just mentioned... so I'm still open for insights. Thank you.\n\n**UPDATE:** Okay, I think I fixed it. Some of you suggested to use btrfs instead of ext4 for my root partition, which I did. It actually worked wow! I'm not in the pacstrap installation, and I hope it'll go smooth sailing from here.\n\nI learned a lot. Thank you so much!\n\nPS: If y'all like to suggest something, I'd be open for anything. Or if formatting my root partition isa  bad idea, please do tell me why :))",

Note: ive got three notebooks where i want to install Keepass - instances.\n\nAnd that said: i want to store the \\`.kdbx\\` file from Keepass on GDrive - i have no other Option. OR do you have some recommendations!?\n\nsome **assumptions**: I guess that it is encrypted in the keepass-installation on my device just before it even lands in Google Drive.  \nSo i guess that this file will be on Google Drive encrypted — completely  :grinning\\_face:\n\n...subsequently the content can only be decrypted with my so alled:\n\n**Master password**\n\n* optional Keyfile, and AES-256 encryption\n\n...that means that Google CANNOT see the passwords. They only see \"an encrypted file\".\n\nThs is good for the security-Level\n\nThe password database is then (consequently) protected by:\n\n* AES-256 or ChaCha20 (depending on the setting) Key Derivation Function (Argon2 or AES-KDF) Key transformation rounds Option: additionally \\*\\*Keyfile for 2-factor encryption\n\nthat makes me lucky - cause: even if someone steals the file from Google Drive:\n\nnow the **question**: whats your recommendation for the setup: i want to use MX-Linux, then what is the best solution to connect to Google Drive!?\n\n**whats your recommendation** No. 1 here which tool, would you go to use?:\n\nshould i use → Rclone + systemd mount (stable, secure, 100% controllable)\\*\\*\n\nsome of my friends told me that i should go with Rclone: They are convinces by **Rclone** since it\n\n\\* Works perfectly on most Linux  \n\\* Extremely reliable  \n\\* Very actively maintained  \n\\* Encryption \\*optional\\* possible\n\nThe **question is**: Can i use it with LXQT too - or do i have to use KDE (or such things!?)\n\ni look forward to hear from you\n\nregards ",

    "title": "About the wrong resolution problems with NVIDIA 580.105.08-3, should I just wait for an update that fixes that? Or how I can downgrade the package?",
    "body": "After NVIDIA was updated to version 580.105.08-3 the system no longer detects some resolutions on some monitors. For example, I have an ultra wide monitor (2560×1080) but after the update it only detects up to 1920x1080. I'm using KDE and Wayland.\n\nI searched on the forum and they recommend to downgrade the package: [https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=310035&amp;p=2](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=310035&amp;p=2)\n\nAnd apparently [NVIDIA is working on a fix.](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/580-release-feedback-discussion/341205/795)\n\nSo I tried to downgrade the packages with a \n\n    sudo pacman -U nvidia-580.95.05-9-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst nvidia-settings-580.95.05-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst nvidia-utils-580.95.05-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst lib32-nvidia-utils-580.95.05-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst nvidia-lts-1:580.95.05-7-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst\n\nbut after that mkinitcpio fails because it can't find the modules for NVIDIA, I think it might be because the kernel was also updated (6.17.7.arch1-1 -&gt; 6.17.8.arch1-1), so the old 580.95.05-9 modules won't work with the new kernel. I don't know if I would need to compile the old drivers for them to work. \n\nBut at this point I thought, well, this wrong resolution is annoying but not that bad, this PC is not my daily driver, right now I'm very sick and I should rest instead of dealing with this, so I was thinking to just wait for an upgrade that fixes this. Some day. Hopefully.",

I’m sharing my solution to hopefully make the process clearer for others who run into the same issue.\n\n⚠️Disclaimer⚠️ This setup was tested on my HP Envy (model: 13-ba0010nr) with a Realtek ALC245 codec on Arch Linux (PulseAudio). Other HP models or audio backends (PipeWire, etc.) may require small adjustments. I can only guarentee function if you have these exact specifications  \nEven if you have a different model, I'm hoping this guide will at least help push you in the right direction. If you have a different model and this does work, please let me know!\n\n# Required Dependencies\n\nIf using pipewire: pipewire-pulse\n\n    sudo pacman -S pipewire pipewire-pulse wireplumber\n\nawk (usually preinstalled but try it just to be safe)\n\n    sudo pacman -S gawk\n\nalsa-tools\n\n    sudo pacman -S alsa-toolsalsa-toolssudo pacman -S alsa-tools\n\nalsa-utils\n\n    sudo pacman -S alsa-utils\n\n# Audio (Speaker) LED Setup:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Codec Device**\n\nRun this command in a terminal:\n\n    grep \"Speaker Playback Volume\" /proc/asound/card*/codec*\n\nYou’ll get output similar to:\n\n    /proc/asound/card0/codec#0: Control: name=\"Speaker Playback Volume\", index=0, device=0\n\nThis means your codec device is **hwC0D0**.  \nYours might differ (usually **hwC0D0**, **hwC1D0**, or **hwC2D0**). If it does, you will need to correct both .sh files to your corresponding codec device. \n\n**Step 2: Create a Script Directory**\n\nRun this command in a terminal:\n\n    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin/\n\n**Step 3: Create the Audio Mute LED Script**\n\nRun this command in a terminal:\n\n* You can name your file whatever you want.

    "body": "Hi, I want to get rid of grub and boot my system directly to Arch Linux. I browsed the wiki and found the article on both tools.\n\nI just wanted to double check with more experienced users if I follow these steps everything will be fine after I reboot (this was compiled by Gemini after it \"searched\" the information on web, including the Arch Linux wiki):\n\n---\n\n### 1. Create the EFI boot entry\n\n* **Find your kernel and initramfs:** Identify the location of your kernel (e.g., `/boot/vmlinuz-linux`) and your initramfs (e.g., `/boot/initramfs-linux.img`).\n* **Use `efibootmgr` to create the entry:**\n    * To create a new entry, use the following command, replacing paths and parameters as needed:\n\n            sudo efibootmgr --create --disk /dev/sdX --part Y --loader /vmlinuz-linux --label \"Arch Linux\" --verbose --unicode \"root=UUID=YOUR_ROOT_UUID rw initrd=\\initramfs-linux.img\"\n\n    * **Explanation of flags:**\n        * `--disk /dev/sdX --part Y`: Specifies your ESP (e.g., `/dev/sda` and partition `1`).\n        * `--loader /vmlinuz-linux`: Points to your kernel.\n        * `--label \"Arch Linux\"`: Sets the name for the boot entry.\n        * `--verbose`: Provides more output.\n        * `--unicode \"root=UUID=YOUR_ROOT_UUID rw initrd=\\initramfs-linux.img\"`: Sets the kernel parameters. You will need to replace **YOUR\\_ROOT\\_UUID** with your actual root partition's UUID.\n\n*(Note: The user's original text included a \"Save the boot entry\" step, which is redundant as the `--create` command already saves it. I've removed it to avoid confusion.)*\n\n### 2. Remove GRUB\n\n* **Uninstall GRUB:** Once you have verified that you can boot into Arch with the new EFI entry, uninstall GRUB:\n\n        sudo pacman -Rns grub\n\n* **Delete GRUB files:** Remove the GRUB installation directory:\n\n        sudo rm -rf /boot/grub\n\n* **Delete the GRUB boot entry:** Remove the old GRUB entry from the EFI boot manager:\n    * Use `efibootmgr` to find the old GRUB entry number (e.g., `0001`).\n    * Delete it (replacing `0001` with the correct number):\n\n            sudo efibootmgr --bootnum 0001 --delete-bootnum\n\n### 3. Configure the boot order\n\n* **Set your new entry as default:**\n    * Check the output of `efibootmgr` to see the new boot entry's number (e.g., `0002`).\n    * Run `efibootmgr --bootorder XXXX,YYYY` to set your new entry (**XXXX**) as the first to boot, followed by any other entries you want to keep (`YYYY`).\n",

While enabling on-access scanning makes a lot of sense for protecting against real-time threats, this eats up a lot of memory and does not seem scalable across multiple VMs. Setting up a cronjob to scan the system (or just files that are likely to get accessed) seems the more resource conscientious approach. Is the reasonable way to do this to choose between these options depending on what the server is setup to do? i.e. if it were an internet-facing web server to have on-access scanning setup, but if it were just a local Plex server to just do ad hoc or scheduled scanning?\n\nAdditionally, I'm unclear on the differences between clamd and the on access scan daemon. Do I need to always have clamd running even if I just want to do ad hoc/scheduled scans but not on-access scanning? Does clamd similarly keep all virus signatures loaded into memory all the time?",

    "body": "Goal: Install Arch using Btrfs using GRUB2 bootloader and LUKS2 Argon2 encryption on root and /boot.   Setup Snapper for snapshots.\n\nBackground: I was partially following this guide [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiK1cGbyaxs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiK1cGbyaxs) to setup Snapper for snapshots, but the guide doesn't use LUKS2 and that's where I'm running into trouble. I saw that GRUB2 doesn't support LUKS2 using Argon2, but found [https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/grub-improved-luks2-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/grub-improved-luks2-git) that patches it. However I keep running into issues when trying to patch grub whether using 'yay' and 'git clone &amp; makepkg -si'. The farthest I've ever gotten was I think the patch went through and GRUB2 will let me decrypt the drive but it fails to find the UUID to boot into Arch itself. I've exhausted my Googling and Chat AI abilities. Adding the UUID to config file and rebuilding GRUB didn't help.\n\nI'm currently testing this on Win 11 Pro with Hyper V if that makes any difference.\n\nI started over and this screenshot is the error I get when trying to patch GRUB2: [https://imgur.com/a/i9qxqEn](https://imgur.com/a/i9qxqEn)\n\nUPDATE: Decided to try it again from a new VM build and everything worked without having to patch GRUB. I was previously using a checkpoint save which probably didn't include the latest version of GRUB. Thanks all.",

    "title": "Sway help: How to assign workspaces to monitors?",
    "body": "Firstly, I hope it is okay for me to post this here - I'd post this in the SwayWM subreddit but I requested access almost a week ago and haven't heard anything back.\n\nI'm trying to configure a 3-monitor setup that can transition to a single monitor (laptop). I've gotten pretty much everything working but I cannot get the workspaces to cooperate. \n\nHere's the script that I have run at startup and when I refresh the config:\n```lua\n#!/usr/bin/env lua\n\nlocal function contains(table, value)\n\tfor i, val in ipairs(table) do\n\t\tif val == value then\n\t\t\treturn true\n\t\tend\n\tend\n\treturn false\nend\n\nhandle = io.popen('echo \"$(swaymsg -t get_outputs -r)\" | jq -r \".[] | .name\"')\n\nif not handle then\n\terror('Unable to execute command')\nend\n\nmonitors = {}\nfor line in handle:lines() do\n\ttable.insert(monitors, line)\nend\nhandle:close()\n\nfor i,mon in ipairs(monitors) do\n\tprint(mon)\nend\nif contains(monitors, \"DP-3\") and\n   contains(monitors, \"DP-1\") and\n   contains(monitors, \"eDP-1\") then\n\tprint('Outputs found...')\n\tos.execute('swaymsg output eDP-1 pos 1920 100 scale 1.5 res 1920x1080')\n\tos.execute('swaymsg output DP-1  pos 1920 100 scale 1.5 res 1920x1080')\n\tos.execute('swaymsg output DP-3  pos    0   0 scale 1   res 1920x1080')\n\tos.execute('sed -i \\'s/eDP-1/DP-3/g\\' ~/.config/waybar/config.jsonc')\nelseif contains(monitors, \"DP-3\") and\n       contains(monitors, \"eDP-1\") then\n\tprint('Projector not found, setting up for two monitors...')\n\tos.execute('swaymsg output eDP-1 pos 1920 100 scale 1.5 res 1920x1080')\n\tos.execute('swaymsg output DP-3  pos    0   0 scale 1   res 1920x1080')\n\tos.execute('sed -i \\'s/eDP-1/DP-3/g\\' ~/.config/waybar/config.jsonc')\nelse\n\tprint('Outputs NOT found...')\n\tos.execute('swaymsg output eDP-1 pos 0 0 scale 1.25 res 1920x1200')\n\tos.execute('sed -i \\'s/DP-3/eDP-1/g\\' ~/.config/waybar/config.jsonc')\nend\n```\n\nI've tried including `os.execute('swaymsg workspace 1 output DP-3')` etc for all 9 workspaces after setting up the outputs but it always just seems to assign them randomly. Any idea how I can get it to assign the workspaces correctly?\n\nEDIT: In digging through the documentation a bit more, I came across this:\n\n&gt; workspace &lt;name&gt; output &lt;outputs...&gt;\n\n&gt; Specifies that workspace name should be shown on the specified outputs. Multiple outputs can be listed and the first available will be used. If the workspace gets placed on an output further down the list and an output that is higher on the list becomes available, the workspace will be moved to the higher priority output.\nThis command does not affect existing workspaces. To move an existing workspace, use the move command in combination with the workspace criteria (non-empty workspaces only) or workspace command (to switch to the workspace before moving).\n\n&gt; [https://man.archlinux.org/man/sway.5.en](https://man.archlinux.org/man/sway.5.en)\n\nSo if I'm reading this correctly, it sounds like I could define all of the workspaces in the sway config file, including the fallback monitor in the same line. For example in `~/.config/sway/config`:\n```\nworkspace 1 output DP-3 eDP-1\nworkspace 2 output eDP-1\nworkspace 3 output DP-1 eDP-1\nworkspace 4 output DP-3 eDP-1\n``` \netc.\n\nIf I'm understanding correctly, this will assign them when the config is reloaded and they don't already exist. I'll try this tomorrow.\n\nEDIT2: It worked! Yay!",

This makes me think something changed with the `nvme` module or its dependencies in the newer kernel.\n\nDid the `nvme` module get split, or does it now require another specific module (like `nvme_core` or maybe `vmd`?) to be explicitly loaded in the `MODULES` array?\n\nHas anyone else with a minimal `HOOKS=(base)` config run into this?

    "body": "I don't think it is a mouse issue per se, but upon installing more than 1 DE on fresh install of Arch, I have at least one DE exhibiting this strange \"mouse drag\" behavior, where I move a mouse a lot, but it moves in microsteps\n\nLast time it happened when I installed XFCE on top of Cinnamon Arch. Xfce was rendered usuable with same issue\n\nI have reinstalled Arch around 5 times experimenting with DEs and if I install more than 1, another instance flat out breaks just like here.\n\nThis time it is 2nd DE that is freaking out\nAs a side note, when I played a game (when it was working on this DE), mouse was very slow, but I could move the mouse fine on desktop\n\nUpon restarting to see if game issue was solved, I was met oncw again with this strange behavior\n\nBut it seems to be affecting not just a mouse. Whole DE seems to be malfunctioning\n\nI am installing additional DEs based on directions. \n\nCan someone explain this issue? \nThis is a 5th time reinstalling Arch and there is at least one DE that breaks in exact same way\n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/scyCRLdSeNA?si=MW9kX_-3j-K3NpTC\n\n\nSide note: This usually happens with 2nd DE I install, 1st one (native) remains fine, and following DEs (after 2nd one) can be fine. I don't understand the reason, because it's not tied to a specific DE, it can be anything that I picked for a 2nd install. The following ones for some reason are fine too. \n\nAlso, removing lxde and lxdm, then reinstalling does not solve the issue. Previously (on one of my Arch installs), I had xfce installed as a second DE, and removing it and reinstalling it did not solve this issue either.\n\nIt's like 2nd DE is perpetually bugged, and I don't get it, do I need to install 3 of them, and then remove 1 to bypass that issue? It's so strange",

    "body": "I have arch install on a Dell Latitude 5591, version with integrated graphics only (intel 630)\n\nSystem worked fine in the past, but was not updated for maybe a year and a half. Recently I did a full update, after which system started to freeze completely pretty quickly after boot.  \nIt seems like it gets semi-unresponsive before reaching hard freeze state. For example, you can type some commands in terminal (like vim), and wait forever, sometimes you can Ctrl-C out of it, but in like 20 seconds or so after being semi-unresponsive system will reach a hard freeze state: no longer responding to any input, doesn't answer pings, etc; only hard power reset helps. Sometimes it happens quite fast so you don't have time to even login, sometimes a bit later.\n\nI booted an old arch iso that I had nearby (archlinux-2023.06.01-x86\\_64.iso) to try and run some diagnostics, to no avail.  \nThen I wanted to to update BIOS with fwupdmgr, but couldn't do it with old iso without updating (or I thought so), so I burned the newest one (archlinux-2025.11.01-x86\\_64.iso).  \nAnd now I have the same hard freeze problem with arch iso as I have with my own system, it also makes the system hard freeze very quickly after boot.  \nSomewhat of a relief, but not quite. Then I read somewhere that using \"nomodeset\" kernel parameter can help circumvent the problem, and it does, no freezes happen when loading my system with nomodeset, but it doesn't seem like a quality solution.\n\nAlso tried to downgrade to lts kernel (6.12.57-1), to no avail.\n\nmemcheck said ok.\n\njournalctl -b -1: [https://pastebin.com/84vbN7dq](https://pastebin.com/84vbN7dq)",

I was about to upgrade my PC anyway so why not experiment? In a call with my friends I said that I’m done with the Microsoft crap and I left the call and immediately went to install arch. And post install it was just as good as I thought it would be, I started with KDE, downloaded all my stuff, transferred files and it all worked perfectly. Then for like a month I dug through the rabbit hole and tried hyprland, then went back to kde, tried dual booting. And yes sometimes the troubleshooting can be annoying but once I got to know my way around the terminal it all worked out perfectly. I can now proudly call myself an arch user!

    "title": "2 years in and I finally feel somewhat knowledgable",
    "body": "So I had to nuke some harddrives (dealing with someone who got access to my google accounts, and potentially my computer(s), so had to go scorched earth on my setup.  Was painfully necessary unfortunately) and I had gotten more than a little lazy when it comes to security.  So when I started rebuilding my setup I installed Arch onto an encrypted thumbdrive and used BTRFS (BTRFS isn't the fastest solution for an operating system on a USB thumbdrive by the way) with separate subvolumes for the logs, var, home, and root folders.  This made for a great setup for snapshots, but I really wasn't considering the implications for when I eventually migrated from a thumbdrive to an SSD.\n\n  \nCut to a few days ago, I finally decide to buy a new NVME SSD for my laptop (I wasn't the only person hacked, and the authorities have been involved, so I'm fairly sure that this person won't be making any further moves moving forward, if I had to guess) and legitimize my Arch install.  I also wanted to get more space and speed things up--even with a barebones Arch install using Hyprland, the speed for random reads and writes is pretty abysmal, and I am usually doing development on my PC's these days.\n\n  \nSo I go to migrate my install and realize...this is a bit more complicated than a simple 'rsync -aHAXS /mnt/source /mnt/target'.  Having to recreate the filesystem, setup the encryption, copy all of the subvolumes, ensure that everything interacts with everything else correctly is a bit, well, intense, all things considered.\n\nHowever, after a day or so of transferring (good god usb thumbdrive's are slow.  Less than 1 million files and 220GB took literally 24 hours to fully copy) and a couple hours of setup, I unplugged my thumbdrive on reboot, sure I'd absolutely fucked up SOMETHING along the way but...\n\n  \nShe boots.  No problems, no missing anything, no hitches, everything in place.  Even my browser history and tmux settings are in tact.  Literally everything is there and everything works.  For the first time since I switched to Linux 2 years ago, I've successfully completed a somewhat complicated operation, with zero problems, zero issues, and zero caveats.\n\nI know in the grand scheme of things, this is somewhat minor.  But I just feel like I finally achieved some base level of competency in Linux that I'd spent decades at in Windows.  I did my first data migration when I was 12 years old in Windows, and while it's a bit simpler in an unencrypted Windows 98 installation than it is in pretty much any Arch Linux installation, still.  Just feels good.\n\n  \nAnyways, that's all I got.  Silly?  Sure.  But my foray into learning Linux started with Ubuntu (ugh) and, even though Arch is better, it's MUCH more intricate for doing things that matter.  I've only recently started using regex regularly, I picked up neovim finally a few months ago, and it took me almost a year to even try tmux.  Normally it wouldn't take this long, but the whole reason I began learning Linux was because I was getting into machine learning and trying to figure out how to utilize, make, and dissect LLMs and see what makes them tick--so it was buy a used Mac or install Linux.  Linux is/was the 'free' option, so that became my go-to.  I dual booted for a year, and only recently decided to go Arch only.  I finally feel comfortable editing config service files, and the only time I refer to documentation is when trying out new software.  I've learned how to use cmake/ninja/bazel/git (although I'm still somewhat novice with these, I can use them functionally), and I even branched out from Python to relearn some C++ and mess around with Zig.\n\n  \nI'm far from a guru, but I do like being competent, at the very least.  I need to learn more about the base programs/services that (most) Linux distributions ship with (like sed, grep, and others--I still just use grep for 'grep -r \"\\[search query\\] .\" and the like, ,or 'ps aux | grep' or 'lsmod | grep' etc etc; basic stuff), but I at least have a grasp on all of the different things that CAN be done.  From there it's just a quick --help or google search to figure out how to do what I want to do.\n\n  \nI dunno, it's just nice to have done all this myself, put the onus on myself to learn everything I have (I have had no job, school, or other outside influence on me to pick any of this up--in fact, I spent 90% of my free time playing competitive video games before all of this, so learning to program and to use Linux was more than a bit of a left turn all things considered), and it's beginning to pay off in some really rewarding ways.\n\n  \nP.S. setting up a tmux/bash script to display CPU/GPU/RAM/VRAM/DISK utilization in my status bar has been probably my favorite part of it all.  Customizing tmux is super fun, and keeping my eye on all of that hardware information keeps me from having to have htop/btop open in an adjacent pane while running various programs.\n\n  \nThanks for reading my blog /s",

    "body": "I was wondering how to deal with a hostile maintainer who is squatting on a set of packages, but refuses to update them in a timely manner or to make improvements / fixes to the packages.\n\nThe packages in question are wlcs, mir, and miracle-wm. I have been the one to update the packages this year, after a previous conflict where the current maintainer added me as a co-maintainer. They only did so when I opened an orphaned request after weeks of not updating the package, with zero communication.\n\nThis person doesn't communicate, doesn't make sense when they are forced to, and acts down right hostile. I don't think they even use the packages, rather is interested in collecting AUR packages like they are pokemon, as they currently post on github \"maintainer of 450+ AUR packages\". They actually swooped in to claim the mir package after I sent in an orphan request so I could adopt it.",

    "body": "I know this is technically not really a question about arch linux but I know at least people in this sub will have experience with dual booting.\n\nI just built a new PC with an ASUS motherboard to replace my laptop with an MSI motherboard. I moved over my arch linux drive intact and reinstalled windows since I didn’t trust it to continue functioning properly on a new machine with totally different hardware.\n\nFor some reason, windows decided to install its boot loader into my linux EFI partition. This would have been fine except for the fact that it made it so that on every windows boot, it would completely delete GRUB from\nmy NVRAM. Every single time. I ended up moving all of the linux boot files to another EFI partition so it would stop doing that.\n\nOnly issue is that now instead of deleting GRUB from my boot options on every boot, it just makes itself the first boot option, meaning that every time I boot into windows any subsequent boot will also boot into windows instead of grub. This is actual malware-type behavior, and I have no idea how to make it stop doing this. Anybody else have this happen?\n\nEDIT: I fixed it by moving the EFI partition off of my linux drive, which was on a SATA SSD, to the end of my storage drive, which is an nvme SSD. The moment I did that and reinstalled grub to make sure it booted right windows stopped messing with my boot order. I do not know why windows specifically doesn’t like that it’s lower in boot priority to a sata drive but i guess it’s fine now.",

This is useful after a large file copy. Disk write cache and swap both stay full and the system actually slows down. i don't know why Linux doesn't automatically release this memory after a large file copy is complete. But it doesn't for whatever reason. This set of commands dumps the cache and reclaims that memory. It gives the computer a bit of a boost. It's quite noticeable on lower end hardware.\n\nTrim: trims all volumes.\n\nupdate: updates repo packages and aur packages, the default behavior for paccache is to keep the last three packages in cache and clear the rest. I do this to save disk space. I can always roll back beyond that with the downgrade tool if need be. Updates snap and flatpaks. I don't' have any snaps installed. But i have that in the command just in case i ever do.\n\nInstall / remove: pretty obvious what those do.\n\nfind: searches the repo and aur for packages.\n\nbuild: tells it to build an AUR package\n\nClean: displays orphaned packages from both pacman and yay and prompts you to remove them.\n\nOrphans: only list the orphans, does not remove them.\n\nRank: uses reflector to search for and rank mirrors. \n\nAnyways. that's what i got.

Installed fl studio and now need a way to access my sounds within the VM without giving windows access to the home folder :D\n\n\n\n\n\nI've decided to switch to arch linux. As a complete beginner I understand that this is a risky move, but I desire to learn and grow through this journey.\n\nI had to leave behind windows because i couldn't make a partition big enough for my linux endeavor, so I decided to just install arch on the whole drive: I used archinstall, encrypted the ssd and I'm using the hardened linux kernel bc I'd like to bring some privacy and digital security back into my life (i did install and activate a firewall too).\n\nNow, I bought and I've been using Fl Studio for quite some time and after looking at a couple of wine tutorials, specific for this topic, I thought I could get it working. I did get it to work somewhat, but got quite a few errors and unfortunately don't have an audio interface compatible with linux.\n\nMy 2 main questions are:\n\n1. Is it possible to get it working, perhaps using a solution like \"bottles\" and routing my audio properly using carla (or something a bit more intuitive) in a way that works?\n2. would it be a viable option to dualboot windows on the same encrypted ssd without having to start over from scratch (which I wouldn't mind too much)?\n\nI'll provide some extra information if needed and any help would be highly appreciated...\n\nSome extra info I feel might be useful for you to know: running kde plasma 6, i set up timeshift on this partition using RSYNC, BTRFC file structure...\n\nI set it all up today so I will take all recommendations into consideration and I'm willing to start fresh and vanilla arch is not a must as long as I'm able to customize everything and make music :)\n\nThank you so unbelievably much in advance and whether you help me or are just passing by, thank you for existing!",

I need the phone app specifically because I also listen during my long commute, so switching to a separate audiobook player \\[and yes I know cozy and it's nice\\] isn’t an option.\n\nWhat I’m trying to find is basically any way to get my phone’s audio onto my PC wirelessly with low latency whether that’s a proper audio-streaming method, some trick to make wireless ADB actually survive a phone reboot so I don’t have to crawl under my desk every time, or even some PipeWire/ADB/Wi-Fi workaround that isn’t laggy.  \n\n\nI tried scrcpy and it works, but I have to reconnect via USB ADB every time the phone restarts, because my PC’s USB ports are hard to reach. The whole replug USB to re-authenticate ADB step gets annoying fast.\n\nmy network setup: My phone is my hotspot. The hotspot connects to a Wi-Fi repeater. My PC connects to the repeater via ethernet cable.\n\n  \nnote: yes I know changing the listing time manually btween phone and pc is a choice, but I'm lazy and in CS, I will freaking make an app if I had too.

For example, I have an ultra wide monitor (2560×1080) but after the update it only detects up to 1920x1080. I'm using KDE and Wayland.\n\nI searched on the forum and they recommend to downgrade the package: [https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=310035&amp;p=2](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=310035&amp;p=2)\n\nAnd apparently [NVIDIA is working on a fix.](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/580-release-feedback-discussion/341205/795)\n\nSo I tried to downgrade the packages with a \n\n    sudo pacman -U nvidia-580.95.05-9-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst nvidia-settings-580.95.05-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst nvidia-utils-580.95.05-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst lib32-nvidia-utils-580.95.05-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst nvidia-lts-1:580.95.05-7-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst\n\nbut after that mkinitcpio fails because it can't find the modules for NVIDIA, I think it might be because the kernel was also updated (6.17.7.arch1-1 -&gt; 6.17.8.arch1-1), so the old 580.95.05-9 modules won't work with the new kernel. I don't know if I would need to compile the old drivers for them to work. \n\nBut at this point I thought, well, this wrong resolution is annoying but not that bad, this PC is not my daily driver, right now I'm very sick and I should rest instead of dealing with this, so I was thinking to just wait for an upgrade that fixes this.

I just ran into my first ever Kernel panic today and it seems to be tied to hibernation. I first encountered this issue when I let the battery drain to 0 for the first time and just as the system was about to enter hibernation I encountered a Kernel panic with a \"fatal exception in interrupt\" message and no information in the panic report except for the arch version. Manually triggering hibernate using systemctl hibernate seems to trigger this same issue every single time, so I am quite sure that's the reason. Journalctl also only shows the system entering hibernation after shutting down the main cpu threads and nothing after that. Any help on this is appreciated; I also wasn't really able to find how to change the normal empty battery handling routine so the system just shuts down instead of hibernating so some guidance on that would be appreciated while I am dealing with this issue.",

    "body": "I don't think it is a mouse issue per se, but upon installing more than 1 DE on fresh install of Arch, I have at least one DE exhibiting this strange \"mouse drag\" behavior, where I move a mouse a lot, but it moves in microsteps\n\nLast time it happened when I installed XFCE on top of Cinnamon Arch. Xfce was rendered usuable with same issue\n\nI have reinstalled Arch around 5 times experimenting with DEs and if I install more than 1, another instance flat out breaks just like here.\n\nThis time it is 2nd DE that is freaking out\nAs a side note, when I played a game (when it was working on this DE), mouse was very slow, but I could move the mouse fine on desktop\n\nUpon restarting to see if game issue was solved, I was met oncw again with this strange behavior\n\nBut it seems to be affecting not just a mouse. Whole DE seems to be malfunctioning\n\nI am installing additional DEs based on directions. \n\nCan someone explain this issue? \nThis is a 5th time reinstalling Arch and there is at least one DE that breaks in exact same way\n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/scyCRLdSeNA?si=MW9kX_-3j-K3NpTC\n\n\nSide note: This usually happens with 2nd DE I install, 1st one (native) remains fine, and following DEs (after 2nd one) can be fine. I don't understand the reason, because it's not tied to a specific DE, it can be anything that I picked for a 2nd install. The following ones for some reason are fine too. \n\nAlso, removing lxde and lxdm, then reinstalling does not solve the issue. Previously (on one of my Arch installs), I had xfce installed as a second DE, and removing it and reinstalling it did not solve this issue either.\n\nIt's like 2nd DE is perpetually bugged, and I don't get it, do I need to install 3 of them, and then remove 1 to bypass that issue? It's so strange",

The problem is with the login screen.\n\nWhenever I log in(after login), the whole screen goes black for a noticeable amount of time, around 2 seconds, before hyprland shows up. The same thing happens with hyprlock; when I unlock, there’s a brief black screen. Also, I’m not really sure what SDDM is for. I’ve heard that hyprlock can only be used after the screen has already been unlocked, not as the initial lock screen. So I’m using SDDM as the initial lock screen, but I’m not sure if that’s proper arch way. \n\nSo, how do I fix this black screen and completely remove KDE? Also, if there’s a more Arch-native way to display the initial GUI lock screen, I’d like to know.\n\nAlso, if there is no window in the current workspace and I open the terminal, I want that window to open at a size of 320×520, positioned exactly at the center of the screen. If a follow-up window is created, it should inherit and follow the original layout. How can I do this?",

    "body": "Hi everyone,    \nI recently installed Arch Linux with Hyprland, but after GRUB the system pauses around 15 seconds on the “Loading initial ramdisk” message before continuing to boot.  \n  \nMy hardware includes:    \n\\- Ryzen 7 5800X    \n\\- 32 GB RAM    \n\\- NVIDIA RTX 3060    \n\\- Fast NVMe SSD    \n\\- BTRFS filesystem    \n  \nI’ve been using Linux only for a few months, so I’m not an expert. I tried changing the initramfs compression from zstd to lz4—something I read online as a possible fix—but it didn’t help.  \n  \nInterestingly, I also have Arch with XFCE installed on a notebook with a Celeron processor and an ext4 filesystem, and that boots almost instantly.  \n  \nDoes anyone know what might be causing this delay? Thanks in advance for any suggestions!",

Yup. Nvidia and Wayland. \n\nNo problems so far, even hibernation works. \n\nMaybe it's a matter of _when_, not _if_ it breaks?\n\nWhat has your experience with nvidia hardware been like? ",

point when something is done with the NVMEs in my PC. I can't really figure out what the problem might be. That both NVMEs are being affected lets me think there might be a motherboard failure? It would surprise me though, because i just build my system with brand new parts about a month ago and it otherwise runs completely fine.\n\nI am very willing to investigate further on my own, but right now i have no clue as to where to start or rather in what direction.\n\nThanks a lot for any help!",

~~I hope that long link pasted in properly~~\n\nThe /etc/fstab file looks fine.\n\nLooking into the pacman log, it looks like the boot partition is full...  \nIt's 350MiB and 349.27MiB are used.. how do i free up space or enlarge the partition when i cant boot into it? Can i just shrink the root partition and expand the boot partition with gparted or something through a live-USB? Oh, or can i shrink the SWAP partition for it? partition table is\n\n1. boot - fat32 - 350 MiB\n2. SWAP - linuxswap - 8 GiB\n3. arch\\_os - ext4 - 1.8 1TiB",

    "body": "Hi! Recently I've noticed that my **CPU** fans speed up to max speed after doing, well anything. To test it, I've left the computer playing a youtube video and i didn't touch the keyboard nor the mouse - the fans acted normal. However after i opened discord or quite frankly any other application the fans instantly ramp up to max speed, just to after like 5-15 seconds slow down, and then speed up. This also happens after doing something inside an app eg. loading a discord server/sending a message.\n\nI don't think that this is a hardware issue. Here are some specs (if any more data is needed, I'll provide it when asked):\n- i5-11600K (i don't overclock)\n- 32 GB of RAM\n- NVIDIA GTX 1660 Ti\n- I use KDE Plasma (wayland) (KWin)\n- kernel: linux-zen 6.17.7-zen1-1-zen ",

Thank you\n\nUPDATE: Solved! The answer was in the github issues thread, which I had overlooked initially. All I had to do was install `python-setuptools` via pacman. Though there are comments in this thread discussing about how setuptools won't be available at the end of the year, as well as alternate methods I should've done to install. Thank you to everyone who commented!",

I've also checked the desktop files of one that's behaving correctly and one that isn't, but there isn't any difference.\n\nI sometimes have to recreate the shortcut until it opens correctly, or if I'm lucky, i just need to change the link slightly (http to https, vice versa, or remove it completely)\n\n  \nHas anyone else experienced this issue, or any ideas what might be causing this?\n\n",

    "body": "I understand. I do. You create the next great library, and everybody wants to use it, so other packages start adding your package as a dependency. Fine. Of course. That's how it works.\n\nAnd you keep developing your package, fixing bugs, adding features. Naturally.\n\nBut when a package decides to depend on a specific feature of a library dependency that it added in version X.Y.Z, do they have to depend explicitly on version X.Y.Z in the library linkage? In the package description?\n\nIf a library adds a feature at a major version increment, say, oh, I dunno, version 76. Then, it makes sense for a dependent package to specify that it needs at least 76 of that library, because it goes to reason that a feature add is not going to evaporate with version 77, 78, etc. It'll be there in perpetuity. And if it does have to be removed, it makes sense that dependent packages will just update their dependencies for one last release that works with the old library, and then change their package to not depend on that specific feature and update their dependencies for a new release that can use the newer library without that feature moving forward. Fine.\n\nBut if I have version 76 of the library installed, and your package depends explicitly on version 76, then if that library gets upgraded to, oh, I dunno, say version 78, if I can't update your package, because it's not a publicly available package, because your executables require, say, libicui18n-76, and upgrading to icu-78 removed it, because it can't know your out-of-band package depends on it, YOUR PACKAGE IS GONNA BREAK!\n\nThe package in question was my company's ZScaler VPN. And its dependency was indeed on libicu\\*-76. If ZScaler's executables just depended on libicu\\*, instead of libicu\\*-76, nothing bad would have happened.\n\nLuckily, my Linux workstation can still reach out to the public internet when the ZScaler fails, I just lose access to all in-house resources.\n\nI just did `sudo tar -xvf /var/cache/pacman/pkg/icu-76.1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst usr/lib/libicu*.so.76* -C /` piecemeal until ZScaler would run again.\n\nProblem was, that wasn't my first resort. First, I tried to just `sudo pacman -Up /var/cache/pacman/pkg/icu-76.1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst`. And that revealed a half dozen packages that depended explicitly on icu-78. So, they needed to be downgraded back to their previous version that only depended on icu-76 as well.\n\nThen, `pacman` stopped working.\n\nOr course `yay` was crippled as well.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause they depended on icu-78 explicitly as well. They just didn't have it listed in their dependencies.\n\nThat's why `pacman` cheerfully lobotomized itself when I told it to roll back icu to version 76, when the `pacman` executable explicitly depended on icu-78 libraries. Double checked `pacman -Qi pacman`. Nope! Nary a mention of icu at all.",

    "title": "[SOLUTION] Standby/Suspend Issues on Linux – Permanently Disable ACPI Wakeup",
    "body": "**PERFORM AT YOUR OWN RISK!**  \nIncorrect usage can cause your system to behave unexpectedly.\n\n# Introduction\n\nAfter a long search, I finally found the cause of my standby/suspend problem. In my case, it was certain ACPI wakeup entries that are enabled by default and prevent the system from entering suspend mode properly.\n\nBy manually disabling individual entries and creating a small script, it’s now possible to get suspend working reliably.\n\n# 1. Identifying the Problem\n\nOpen a terminal and check your wakeup configuration—for example, with:\n\n    cat /proc/acpi/wakeup\n\nEntries that are set to **enabled** can prevent the standby mode from working.\n\nTo test it, you can disable an entry like this:\n\n    sudo sh -c 'echo PTXH &gt; /proc/acpi/wakeup'\n\n⚠️ **WARNING:**  \nOn my system it was the entry **PTXH** that prevented suspend from working. On your system it might be a different one. So you must replace **PTXH** with the entry that is causing the issue on your machine.\n\nThe state will then switch from **enabled** to **disabled**.\n\n📌 **Note:**  \nTest after each disabled entry using:\n\n    systemctl suspend\n\nIf suspend works, you’ve found the culprit.\n\n# 2. Wakeup Resets After Every Restart\n\nSince the file `/proc/acpi/wakeup` resets to default after every boot, you need a script that runs automatically at startup.\n\nMy file looked like this (yours may differ):\n\n*(screenshot reference omitted)*\n\n# ✅ Step-by-Step Guide\n\n# 1. Create a Bash Script\n\nCreate a script:\n\nGo to the path `/usr/local/bin/` and create a new text file there (e.g., using the editor *Kate*).\n\nInsert the following:\n\n    #!/bin/bash\n    \n    # Check if PTXH is enabled and disable it if necessary\n    if grep -q \"PTXH.*enabled\" /proc/acpi/wakeup; then\n        echo \"PTXH\" &gt; /proc/acpi/wakeup\n    fi\n\nSave it in the path above under the name [**disable-ptxh.sh**](http://disable-ptxh.sh) and close the editor.\n\nMake the script executable:\n\n    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/disable-ptxh.sh\n\n# 2. Create a Systemd Service to Run the Script at Boot\n\nCreate a service file:\n\nGo to the path `/etc/systemd/system/` and create a new text file there (e.g., with *Kate*).\n\nInsert the following:\n\n    [Unit]\n    Description=Disable PTXH ACPI Wakeup\n    After=multi-user.target\n    \n    [Service]\n    Type=oneshot\n    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/disable-ptxh.sh\n    \n    [Install]\n    WantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nSave it under the name **disable-ptxh.service** and close the editor.\n\n# 3. Enable the Service\n\n    sudo systemctl daemon-reload\n    sudo systemctl enable disable-ptxh.service\n\n(Optional: test immediately)\n\n    sudo systemctl start disable-ptxh.service\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWith this method, I was finally able to stop a specific ACPI entry from blocking suspend mode. If you’re experiencing similar problems, it’s worth checking the entries in `/proc/acpi/wakeup` and disabling the ones causing issues.\n\nGood luck — and as always: make system changes at your own responsibility!\n\n",

    "title": "Things that tripped me up doing a fresh installation",
    "body": "Mercifully the only time I have to deal with Windoze is being the IT manager for my 82-year-old mom and her Lenovo Ideapad S145.\n\nI foolishly told her to accept Microsoft's kind offer of Windows 11 since its constant popups and threats made her even more confused than usual. Long story short, her laptop went from glacially slow to completely frozen, and in the most recent forced \"upgrade\", the Wifi along with its icon get deleted for some reason only Microsoft knows every other reboot.\n\nAnyways, I thought why not install Arch on an old USB storage device I no longer use. Since she mainly just uses her computer to watch youtube videos bashing Harry and Meghan, she doesn't really need anything fancy. She does use Teams to talk to various friends around the world, so a \"dual boot system\" from either the external drive for Arch or internal drive for Windoze seemed a smart idea.\n\nI have kinda gotten this all to work, but it's been way more frustrating than I thought it would be.\n\nThe main headache has been Lenovo's eratic boot menu. Pressing F2 only gets me into the boot screen once every six or so attempts, so a real dice roll.\n\nEven if I instructed the BIOS to give the USB device priority, once Windoze loads, it seems to put itself first on the list again. This means my mom can't simply switch between Linux and Windoze without me pressing F2 dozens of times to get the external drive booting again.\n\nI've now got xfce with Firefox running, and Lenovo's BIOS willing, the laptop boots straight into the windows environment.\n\nNext snag I hadn't encountered before was pacstrap refusing to install a basic system because of key problems. Courtesy of Google I discovered the magic incantation to fix this was:\n\n```\npacman-key --init\npacman-key --populate archlinux\n```\n\nThe next two biggest headaches, predictably, have been sound and WiFi. Xfce's default sound panel applet simply refused to work, so I had to install Pulseaudio even though bare Alsa is supposedly all you need. Something that's a big plus from a few years ago is Alsa is no longer muted by default to trip most newbies up. But I simply couldn't get volume control to work without an additional middleman.\n\nSomething I haven't encountered before is phy0 and wlan0 are powered off by default in the Lenovo laptop, so getting iwd to work took a bit of googling. Since iwd and systemd played nicely together and the wifi was up and running on first boot, I decided to just leave them.\n\nThe snag again is getting a working panel applet. No luck getting iwgtk to work, and I see it's no longer maintained anyway. So it looks like I'll have to switch from iwd and systemd to wpa_supplicant and NetManager so as to use its app.\n\nLong story short, it's been not as easy as I'd hoped, but now hopefully won't randomly break all the time like Windoze 11.",

    "body": "This caught me completely by surprise today. I wasn't aware that they were re-writing the UI and switching to Qt. Imagine my face when I ran my daily system update and saw 255MB of dependencies asking to be installed. I get that GTK4 was a pain to work with and you could tell that it was, the interface was working but felt kludgy. However, dumping 255MB of dependencies for all the non KDE users and especially for those that run lightweight DEs, onto a 7.8MB app, is a hard pill to swallow. Especially considering there isn't another program that is as easy to use and feature rich as EasyEffects. Sure, you could build all your effects chains with LSP-plugins and Carla or something else but EasyEffects holds true to its name. It's easy.\n\nI'm gonna hold off on updating for now but eventually I'll either have to go through the hassle of setting up an alternative or bite the bullet. Any Hyprland, XFCE or Sway or other lightweight DE users here that have any opinions on this? Did you just bite the bullet and install all the deps or have you built an alternative setup?\n\nEdit: Guys, it's not about the storage space. It's about having to install a whole ecosystem for one app. Bloat isn't just an expression of used storage space.\n\nEdit2: Just to clarify further. KDE is not a dependency of Qt. EasyEffects is using kirigami and all that brings along. KDE widgets, breeze-icons etc. You can build an app using Qt6 without all of those things. I may not have made that clear enough initially but I already have all the Qt libraries installed. The 255MB are all KDE stuff, none of it is Qt. That is the core of my complaint. Why all the KDE stuff?\n\nEdit3: Many assume it's about the MB count but that's not it. I'm also surprised they're all missing the point. They chose Arch as their distro. If they're not at least annoyed by this, why didn't they go with any of the other distros that are pre-built? Arch is a DIY distro, having to install stuff you don't want kinda goes against the spirit of Arch. If you don't care about what deps a program pulls in and you're not bothered by having thousands of packages on your system, why did you go with Arch? Why go through all of the hassle of installing Arch if in the end, you don't care? Wouldn't have Manjaro or one of the Ubuntu based distros been more appropriate?",

    "body": "I got myself a new laptop just to play skyrim during my calculus courses, and I'll tell you the story of me trying to install arch on this new device.\n\nI was in one of my calculus courses and got bored, looking for something more... enjoyable(?). At that time I've saw a guy using his laptop to play chess online. He was avoiding boredom, unlike me. That was the spark. I was gonna get a laptop just to play skyrim in class!\n\nI searched the web and found out there is a freedos not good, not bad laptop that respects my wallet. I ordered it online and it arrived 4 days ago. The device I'm talking about is lenovo ideapad 3 15ABR8. It's not fascinating in hardware but I already got a great machine at home that covers all my needs except mobility. So it works for me.\n\nDay-1 installing arch linux on my new pc.  \nI already had a Ventoy all in one Os usb, so I didn’t waste time preparing the installation. The arch iso on my usb was only a month old so there shouldn't have been a problem I taught. I'll cut fast these parts but I failed miserably over and over again. In the \"Rapidly fail\" process I updated my arch iso in the usb, tried manual and archinstall methods, however it didn't worked. I gave up and installed W\\*ndows as a substitute os.\n\nDay-2 &amp; 3 Trying to coop with W\\*ndows.  \nI didn't used windows on my computer like in 2(?) years. It was a little hard to getting used to it. I installed my desired apps, plugins etc. to pc and updated drivers at my 2nd day. It was all good and sweet till I decided to uninstall some of the out-of-the-box apps on day 3. I uninstalled On\\*drive... It fucked up my folder system. I got frustrated and swore to god I'll not gonna use windows and delete it immediately. I slept. It was my bed anyway.\n\nDay-4 Changing to another OS and coming back to home...  \nDay-4 is actually today, I woke up and directly rushed to my pc changing my os to fedora. I had no problems with the fedora installation. It was a sweet relief to see anything but W\\*ndows on my desktop wallpaper. I was tinkering around and eventually opened the terminal. I was gonna install spotify so I entered 'sudo pacman -Syu spotify-launcher'... I felt like I'm in the enemy territory as there was no command called pacman. I ofc know fedora does not use pacman packet manager, but that's what I used to do. I uninstalled fedora too and got my self warmed up to fight. To fight to install arch! I literally wore jeans and a shirt just to get a moral boost.\n\nI started the installation media. I was too careful this time, there was no room for any mistakes. I read every line my eyes could keep up with during the installation process. I slowly partitioned my ssd. Sometimes caressed my monitor as a good luck charm. Failed 3 times this way. After all that, I called a friend. Let's call him Duke. Duke is a cs student, and he is much more familiar with linux and all computers then me. My friend Duke gave me a real advice, 'I'm busy use ai'. I used chatgpt. It also failed to help me but we tried and tried. Installed 3 different arch iso files with rufus, ventoy and balenaetcher just to be 'sure'. We got stuck connecting to wifi sometimes, but in the end we find the problem.\n\nWhen I '/ls boot'ed, while in chroot, there was no fallback image for linux. Even after we overwrote linux, linux-firmware, and mkinitcpio with new installations and redesigned the initramfs 2 to 3 times, there was still no fallback images in /boot. I got curious and look in the initramfs-linux.preset with cat. There was the problem. All lines containing initramfs-linux-fallback.img were commented out. I asked for a correct copy of linux.preset and edited it the way gpt described using nano. Here are the lines it suggested.\n\n&gt;!\\# mkinitcpio preset file for the 'linux' package!&lt;\n\n&gt;!ALL\\_config=\"/etc/mkinitcpio.conf\"!&lt;\n\n&gt;!ALL\\_kver=\"/boot/vmlinuz-linux\"!&lt;\n\n&gt;!PRESETS=('default' 'fallback')!&lt;\n\n&gt;!default\\_image=\"/boot/initramfs-linux.img\"!&lt;\n\n&gt;!default\\_options=\"\"!&lt;\n\n&gt;!fallback\\_image=\"/boot/initramfs-linux-fallback.img\"!&lt;\n\n&gt;!fallback\\_options=\"-S autodetect\"!&lt;\n\nAfter editing linux.preset when I generated initramfs and looked in the boot, there was the initramfs-linux-fallback.img. I reinstalled systemd-boot end rebooted my device. I was victorius.\n\nNow I'm happily installing my skyrim. ",

I went back to x11 cinnamon and all of a sudden vulkan stopped working and I don’t know why.

My computer screen randomly turns off sometimes now and then turns on again. \n\nI decided that okay what the hell I’ll just move my stuff to a usb and then reinstall everything because I’m stupid and I don’t know what else to do. But then I spilled my water on my computer because I’m STUPID. My computer is fine but I unplugged my usb on impulse and now the usb won’t mount. This usb has all of my mom’s pictures of me as a child along with several backups of things (it has 2 tb of storage and I’m pretty sure my family has been using it for years) and now I’m super scared because I think I ruined it. I’m on the verge of having a mental breakdown right now and I don’t want to bother my dad about it because he already told me not to do anything stupid and wreck my computer and guess what! I was stupid again\n\nIf anybody knows how to fix my usb without deleting everything on it that would be a big help (or if you know how to fix any of my other problems). I’m sorry if this isn’t the right place I don’t know where else to look because none of the tutorials I searched up worked. And now I can’t even just reinstall linux because the usb with my backups isn’t there!!!\n\n\n",

It will still store its config files on G:.\n\n• \tGrub2Win will detect the EFI partition and install the bootloader there\n\n• \tYou can then store your ISOs and config on G:\n\nThis is the standard setup for GPT systems.\n\n🔸 Option 2: Convert Disk to MBR (Not Recommended)\n\nYou could wipe the disk and convert it to MBR to get full control over “Primary” and “Active” flags — but this is risky and unnecessary unless you're doing legacy BIOS booting.\n\ncan someone help me give me suggestions or help me choose?\n\nUpdate - (again)\n\nturns out there are alternatives to grub ( im stupid )\n\nill be trying rEFind (sorry if i spelt that incorrectly)\n\nalso i havent even started doing arch yet, im still on making the drive then putting arch on there\n\nwish me luck lol\n\n\\- Update - im going crazy\n\nthe page where the refind file is supposed to be is literally a labrynth,\n\ncopilot says \" look for a file like...\" the problem is looking for that goddamn file is like looking for a needle in an incredibly large haystack the size of the moon, why? because along the way theres like a billion different links, so the haybale also has a bunch of fake needles in it i will continuing updating but i hope that someone may be able to help me\n\n\\- update - im using easybcd now, im pretty sure 10 people working together cant install refind\n\n\\- another one - bcd doesnt work aswell because no iso files are accepted (im actually mentally unstable)\n\ndo i run it through a VM?\n\nUPDATE!!!!\n\non my boot menu theres arch linux now...\n\ncrasy, right?\n\ni mean i did download a vm but i dunno if thats causing it\n\nwhen i select it however an error message appears\n\nim gonna come back and tell you guys what it says\n\nBACK, it says that there was a problem with booting windows or something but im not trying to boot windows\n\nit said something about hardware",

    "body": "I gave it about 63 days before I gave up on it. 60 days ago I thought it was awesome. The past 2 weeks it was just annoying. When it became a bootable iso image I was pretty sure they were going to lose me. I didn't want a new distro. I wanted Arch with a a preconfigured Hyprland and development environment.\n\nI think it is kind of funny/sad how the mindset is is break free from your Mac and then they give you a version of Arch that is becoming more and more Mac like in the sense that you need to use Alacritty if you want these tui's to work right, and their modified chromium if you want these web apps to work right. And, oh I see you changed your keybinds, we're going to just change those back even though you did it the way we suggested. DHH has come up with some newer ones and you'll probably like them better than yours.  What? It changes your whole workflow? Funny you should mention that because we're also going to replace your neovim settings too. You might as well just do things our way.\n\nYeah I know it is an opinionated install, I didn't realize it was going to be opinionated updates as well. Just not for me. I did get some benefit from using it. I discovered lazygit and a few other terminal based applications.\n\nSo now that I am back to a fresh Arch install I figured I would give Cosmic a go. I must say I am pretty impressed with it. I like being able to set tiling or floating per work space.\n\n\\*edit\\*\n\nI had a 2nd PC with Omarchy installed, a little HP Mini. I ended up removing Omarchy tonight and keeping my Arch install by doing the following steps.\n\nDisable the Omarchy seamless login service and renable tty1\n\n    sudo systemctl stop omarchy-seamless-login.service\n    sudo systemctl daemon-reload \n    sudo systemctl start getty@tty1.service\n\nIt is easier if you log in on tty2 (ctrl-alt f2) to do this, When you stop the seamless login service it might kick you to a black screen. Once you get rid of the auto login you can also remove the omarchy decryption graphic and replace it with something prettier. You only need to do this if you are using an encrypted disk. If you aren't using LUKS just skip to the .config folder part.\n\n\"plymouth-set-default-theme -l\" will show a list of the themes. I went with bgrt which is basically the spinner theme with your bios or PC manufacturer's boot logo. You need to make sure you specify the -R flag so it will rebuild the initramfs.\n\n    sudo plymouth-set-default-theme -R bgrt\n\nAt this stage I decided to just move my .config folder and start with a fresh one. You don't have to do this part. If you decide to keep your .config folder and keep hyprland, there is a pretty good chance it will get updated back to omarchy again.\n\n    cd \n    mv .config/ .config.bak \n    mkdir .config\n\nThen I just copied over folders I wanted to preserve and omitted things I didn't mind rebuilding from scratch. Below are just some examples. One thing of note. Omarchy symlinks the themes to a lot of their stuff so if you copy nvim or any of your terminal customizations you might want to consider copying the omarchy folder. At the time of writing this, it only has a themes folder and a current theme folder.\n\n    cd .config\n    cp -r ../.config.bak/chromium .\n    cp -r ../.config.bak/retroarch .\n    cp -r ../.config.bak/nvim .\n\nYou can reboot here. You should get a new plymouth screen with the Arch logo at the bottom and whatever theme you picked\n\nFinally you need to get rid of the omarchy mirror and update your mirror list.\n\n    sudo nvim /etc/pacman.conf\n\nscroll down and comment out or remove these lines.\n\n    [omarchy] \n    SigLevel = Optional TrustAll \n    Server = https://pkgs.omarchy.org/$arch\n\nSave it and then run this to rebuild your mirror list\n\n    sudo pacman -Syyu\n\nAt this point you just need to do one more thing, remove omarchy-chromium\n\n    sudo pacman -R omarchy-chromium\n\nYou can re-install the real Chromium if you want it. Having the omarchy fork there will be problematic if you ever want to update Chromium.\n\nNow you are free to install whatever desktop and window manager you would like to use. If you install SDDM you can set that to auto login and go right into whatever you install.\n\nOmarchy is still going to exist in .local/share/omarchy as a git repo. I am keeping it there so I can cannibalize their themes. :)\n\nI hope this proves useful to some people and gets you back to just using Arch btw.",

But quick search made me discover another pretty cool way: [Arch Linux Archive](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Linux_Archive#How_to_restore_all_packages_to_a_specific_date). \n\nTLDR: You can specify date, and \"rollback\" all packages to the state of Arch repos at that time. No dependencies trouble with rollbacking nvidia, kernel, etc.\n\nI just edited `/etc/pacman.conf` \n\n```\n[core]\nServer=https://archive.archlinux.org/repos/2025/02/25/$repo/os/$arch\n#Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist\n\n[extra]\nServer=https://archive.archlinux.org/repos/2025/02/25/$repo/os/$arch\n#Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist\n\n[multilib]\nServer=https://archive.archlinux.org/repos/2025/02/25/$repo/os/$arch\n#Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist\n```\nrun `pacman -Syyuu` and voila, I am back to nvidia-open 570.86.16-9 with the right kernel and everything.

It assumes that someone that comes from Windons/Mac wants something that's similar, which I feel is dumb, because they switching away right?

Make sure you have python-pipx installed via pacman. note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages. hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.\"\n\n\n\nNow I'm just annoyed and having my fking time wasted.

While the Installation guide is pretty good, there's several little things you probably should do to your system after install, or right now if you never done it before.\n\n* Bootloader\n\nYou should enable automatic updates for your specific bootloader.\n\nSystemd-boot - https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-boot#Automatic_update\n\nGrub - https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GRUB#Warning_to_perform_grub-install/grub-mkconfig_at_each_grub_update\n\nFor others check https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_boot_process\n\n* Locale\n\nIf you use your system in English  but lives outside the US you should set up your locale.conf accordingly, ex.\n\n    LANG=de_DE.UTF-8\n    LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8\n    LC_COLLATE=C.UTF-8\n\n\nIn my case `LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8` guarantee while the system is in English, while `LANG=en_DE.UTF-8` makes that all the other settings are set up to the local German standards.\n\nLC_COLLATE=C.UTF-8 is recommended to be set as `C.UTF-8` by the wiki.\n\nThere's also several other variables that can be set individually but are probably not necessary for the vast majority of people.\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Locale\n\n^Shoutout ^to ^/u/legacynl\n\n* Trim\n\nEnable Trim on your SSDs, either with the discard mount option if you drive and file system support it or using the fstrim.service.\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Solid_state_drive#TRIM\n\n* Makepkg\n\nIf you're constantly using AUR packages you should enable makepkg optimizations. \n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Makepkg#Optimization\n\n* Fonts\n\nInstall the noto-fonts-cjk (or other CJK font pack) so you don't see a bunch of empty squares when people use Chinese Japanese or Korean characters.\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fonts\n\n* Mirrors\n\nInstall and set up Reflector service to keep your mirrors up to date \n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Reflector\n\n* .pacnew\n\nPackage updates will often generate .pacnew files, those files are new config files that have new options or new standards and need to be dealt with promptly. What I do is just run\n\n `$ pacman -Syu &amp;&amp; pacdiff` \n\nand I deal with them immediately, or you can just run \n\n`$ pacdiff` \n\nonce in a while. Not dealing with .pacnew files might cause you problems in the future.\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman/Pacnew_and_Pacsave\n\n* Package cache\n\nClean your package cache periodically so you don't end up with several GB of packages just sitting around.\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman#Cleaning_the_package_cache\n\n* Zram\n\nYou should probably update your old SWAP partiton to Zram, it's better in every way possible, the only caveat is hibernation, I don't use it and I don't know if it's possible to use Zram and still have hibernation.\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Zram\n\nThere's certainly more stuff that I can't think of right now, but leave your tips and I'll update the post with the best ones.",

Not all or even most Arch users, but let's not kid ourselves; they 100% are a loudvocal minority of our group. lol\n\nI've been using Arch as my main OS for over 15 years. When I first started using (roughly 2008-2010, Arch came with an ncurses installer and offline packages bundled in the ISO.\n\nI even quit using Arch for a couple weeks/months once they got rid of it but got so tired of Mint (or whatever I used in its place) that I decided I'd nut up and learn the goddamn manual install process. lmfao\n\nI'm all for making it accessible. Learning manual install process and related commands is useful for learning what goes into a Linux system in general and how to fix problems down the road whether in Arch or another distro, but having an installer is just a convenient feature that does far more good than bad.\n\nMight get us more \"how does i shot arch btw i want the pewdiepie desktop bro\" noob posts, but it's also going to make it more accessible and less intimidating to people who are intellectually endowed and could grow to contribute to the community one day.\n\nAlso funny: It's been so long since there was an Arch installation menu, I have the whole manual installation process memorized and can do it in well under half an hour (never timed myself or anything), so I've never bothered with archinstall script. Ought to next time just to see how it compares to what I remember the ancient install menu having. lmfao",

I like challenges and they thought \"why not jump into cold Waters.\"  \n\nI started installing It on an VM, you know just to get started. Later I found out 90% of my issues were caused by said VM and not by Arch itself. Lol\n\nSure I spent like 2 hours to get it running like I wanted to. Sure I had to read the wiki a shitton. But my god the wiki. I love the wiki so much. Genuinely I'm convinced if you just READ arch isn't that bad. Everything is explained, and everything has links that explain the stuff that isn't explained. \n\nAnd the best part about my 2 hours slamming my keyboard with button inputs to put everything in FOOT (don't judge, I couldn't get kitty to run, and when I was finally able to run it foot kinda looked nice to me lol)... Now I understand every inch of my system. Not like in windows where honestly most registry files are still a mystery to me. No! I've spent so much time in the wiki and hammering in the same commands over and over and editing configs that I understand every tiny little detail of my system. I see something I don't like and know how to change it, or at least I know how to find out how to change it. (The wiki most times lol)\n\nAnd don't even get me started about Pacman. Jesus fucking Christ I've never had fun installing programs in windows before. Pacman is just no bs, get me to where I need to be. (Similarly to KDE Discover, but I've heard it's not so nice since it keeps infos from Pacman, oh well, pacman is good enough even without gui)\n\nThe entire experience was just fun.

Installed Arch Linux + Hyprland again with the help of Arch wiki, success!]\n\nI see a lot of noobs asking the simplest questions in certain subreddits which is justified because well, they are noobs. I was a noob too, actually I'm still a noob and I'm learning about linux. I've come across numerous YouTube videos, blogs and articles about 'linuxing' but none of them clicked. I started out with Debian and really liked how Linux worked without any abstractions. \n\nI dived into the world of linux distro and learned about distro hopping quickly. But at this point I didn't know jackshit about linux, I only used it as a newbie. \n\nEver since I laid my eyes on Arch, I was determined to make Arch my own ('my own' as in being the power user Arch actually expects. Sorry my vocabulary limits me from using more sophisticated words as English is not my first language and I can't put my real feelings behind these words). Also there's this cool prestige among people that Arch Linux users are just better. So I typed 'Arch Linux' on my browser, visited the official website and installed the ISO. And of course, I chose to go with the hardest path i.e, manual installation. Guess what? I failed miserably and I couldn't really understand what was happening behind the hood. I felt defeated and chose to switch to EndeavourOS KDE because I wanted to try out Arch without having to deal with the hassle of installation. \n\n6 months later, I decided that it was time to install arch with hyprland. But this time, I had knowledge about the archinstall script. I installed Arch with no issues at all. This time though, there was another issue. Hyprland. I had no fucking clue about what I was balls deep in. In the end, I failed again.\n\nI had to restore my EndeavourOS setup with Timeshift(thank God I had created a backup earlier). I decided to try again but this time I was determined and clicked every single link I came across while reading the Arch Wiki. I mean yes, it took me a lot of time to install the OS but guess what? I actually knew what I was doing this time. Oh and btw I did all of this in gnome-boxes because I was scared of breaking my system. Now I just gotta do this again which won't take much time ;).\n\nBasically my point in writing this huge ass article is that please stop searching for easier alternatives such as YouTube videos and go read the Arch Wiki. There's tons of information in there and many more I still haven't discovered yet! You'll find everything you seek about Arch and Linux in general in there.\n\nI'll post the screenshots of my setup in the comments after I install Arch on my laptop.\n\nThanks for reading!",

I discovered Neovim and fell in love with it - kudos to the Vim creators!\n\nThe hype around Arch kept catching my attention. After some research, I discovered it centered around Arch's DIY philosophy. Curiosity got the better of me, so I decided to give it a shot in a VM first.\n\nI spent about a week learning the installation process through the ArchWiki, Reddit, and some AI assistance. As I dove deeper, each new term led me down fascinating rabbit holes of knowledge. The Wiki's structure is brilliant - it guides you while encouraging exploration of related concepts. I can confidently say the ArchWiki is the finest documentation I've encountered on the internet. It's not just documentation; it's a masterpiece.\n\nDuring this process, I created my own documentation in Obsidian, and ultimately gained a deep understanding of the GNU/Linux system. When I finally installed Arch on my actual machine, I barely needed to reference anything (except for a post-installation audio issue) - it all came naturally.\n\nI now understand that truly knowing Linux comes from building and maintaining your system yourself.

One of my subjects requires me to compile a micro OS called XINU which was built on an ancient build of gcc. Having access to old versions of gcc through the AUR saved me soo much time. I was able to build and test locally without using the slow university servers.\n\n2. Another course requires me to write mpi programs to implement parallel algos and installing openmpi, running the programs across various cores was seamless. Unlike my friend who has an M1 pro macbook, I did not have to fiddle with any settings or break my head in figuring out why the code was not compiling.\n\n3. My operating system course also had in depth studies on how linux works and using linux gave me an easy way to see real world examples of how linux scheduling, memory management and threading works.\n\nAll of these may seem minor, but they were huge time savers and helped me focus on coding rather than fighting with the OS.

I update every 2-3 days, and its been rock solid.\n\nRecently set up a HP 600 G3 micro pc for the TV to act as media server and steam remote play, and I figured it would make sense to make it a \"stable\" system, so I wouldn't be constantly monitoring it for updates.\n\nAll for different reasons: Chimera, Mint Debian, Zorin, Fedora, all had problems ranging from irritating to broken within a week. Its now got Debian w/ plasma installed, which decided to kill itself when I ran an apt autoremove and took out the whole DE - easy enough fix but I've NEVER had arch decide that install-time packages could be flagged as no longer needed and uninstall them.\n\nThroughout all this, my gf has been watching my frustration. Yesterday she asks me \"why don't you just install the same thing as your desktop pc?\"\n\nThe irony that my bleeding edge desktop was more stable than all these fresh installs has not been lost on me.\n\nMaybe with the end of Windows 10 and Recall creeping over the horizon I can convince her to change as well.\n\n(This post has been inspired by u/Malqus's recent post \"My GF started using Arch\", good luck to her buddy)\n\n  \nEdit: Perhaps I should've quoted the first \"stable\", as some of you guys are bringing up the reliable vs stable debate.

    "body": "The setup contains the following:\n\n* Archlinux + KDE\n* BTRFS File System with Timeshift Snapshots\n* LUKS Encryption\n* Unified Kernel Images\n* systemd Boot\n* Secure Boot with TPM 2 auto-unlock\n* Dual Boot with Windows with Bitlocker enabled\n* SWAP as a File\n* Recovery UKI and BTRFS Snapshot UKI using the LTS Kernel\n* Hardware: Lenovo L560 with Intel i5 and 16GB of RAM\n\n\tSome background to all of this: This my second time installing Archlinux. First time was a minimal bare-bones setup, using GRUB and no security measures. It was still a dual-boot setup with Windows, but no Secure Boot, no TPM and no Encryption, on either OS-es. Basically, it was just a familiarization with Linux and how it works.\n\n\tBut I loved it! The granularity with which an OS can be manipulated and configured, the privacy, the efficiency. It was all astonishing, especially when coming from a life of using Windows (since 1998).\n\n\tThere were still a lot of boxes I wanted to check. Learning about File Systems, CoW, Snapshots, Unified Kernel Images, UEFI, Secure Boot, TPM2, SWAP, Kernels, and many other things. Diving a bit deeper into how an OS works. I believe that with this setup I mostly managed to do that.\n\n\tI’m going to describe a bit of the most interesting particularities of this setup:\n\n**BTRFS File System with Timeshift Snapshots**\n\n\tBTRFS is great, providing some cool functionalities like snapshots and CoW. My goal was to use said snapshots with a simple yet effective app that had a GUI, like Timeshift. Timeshift requires a very specific layout of the btrfs subvolumes in order to work. An “@“ subvolume for the root partition and a “@home” subvolume for the Home user directory. \n\n\tI’ve seen many setups online, and people were using tons of sub-volumes when setting up their btrfs partitions. Some of them made sense, some were just there for the sake of being there. I decided that for my particular use-case, a root subvolume (“@“) and a home subvolume (“@home”) were enough (which is exactly what Timeshift requires).\n\n**Dual Boot with Windows with Bitlocker enabled and TPM2 auto-unlock for both OS-es**\n\n\tA controversial topic in the world of Archlinux was the success rate of dual-booting Archlinux and Windows, both using Secure Boot, TPM2 auto-unlock and Encryption enabled. I haven’t found many specific examples of this setup working successfully, so it was mostly trial and error on my side. I was determined to do it though, documenting myself with the specifics of UEFI, Secure Boot and TPM2. \n\n\tThe conclusion I reached is that Windows and Archlinux can flawlessly work in a dual-boot setup, both having Secure Boot and TPM2 auto-unlock enabled. The trick is to boot them directly from the UEFI Boot menu (this will allow the PCR7 Secure Boot bank to remain unchanged). If you try to boot Windows from the systemd boot menu (which will detect it as an entry), the PCR7 Secure Boot bank value will change and Bitlocker will prompt for the recovery key. Windows generally uses banks 7 and 11. For my Archlinux setup I’ve used banks 0 and 7.  \n\tEDIT: It is not the PCR 7 bank that changes and doesn't allow Windows to boot through systemd-boot, it is PCR 11, although PCR 7 also has a certain impact. As u/6e1a08c8047143c6869 pointed out: \"I think you mean PCR 11? The secure boot state (i.e. secure boot settings, keys, etc.) will not be changed by booting Windows through systemd-boot, but PCR 11 will\" and \"The issue here seems not to be that PCR 7 changes if you use sd-boot, but that Windows looks at all efi executables in the boot chain and refuses to bind the bitlocker key to PCR7 if any of them were signed by something other than themselves.\"\n\n\tOf course other banks can be used as well, for both OS-es, but the setup becomes gradually more complicated and prone to auto-unlock failure. This depends on one’s threat model.\n\n**Recovery UKI and BTRFS Snapshot UKI using the LTS Kernel**\n\n\tI always thought Safe Mode from Windows was pretty cool for debugging and troubleshooting, yet I did not know how to access something similar on linux. \n\n\tI eventually found out about systemd emergency target, so I created an UKI with mkinitcpio that had the a cmdline file addition that uses the following attribute: “systemd.unit=emergency.target”. This is used to boot the system into an “emergency / minimal” mode using systemd. From here on you can do various things since you have a shell available at your disposal. \n\n\tAnother UKI I made, was one that took advantage of the BTRFS snapshots feature. This one uses the following cmdline addition: “rootflags=subvol=/timeshift-btrfs/snapshots/YYYY-MM-DD\\\\\\_HH\\\\\\_MM\\\\\\_SS/@“ in order to create a UKI that boots a read/write snapshot directly. You can even use Timeshift from within the snapshot to restore the system to a previous point. It was pretty cool and fun when I actually got to see it boot!\n\n\tI decided that both of these \"recovery\" UKIs should use the LTS kernel, as a safety measure. The standard boot entries use the stable Linux kernel.\n\nI basically had 3 cmdline files in my /etc/kernel folder and 2 mkinitcpio presets (linux and linux-lts)\n\n1. The default one “cmdline” using the stable kernel.\n2. The emergency one “cmdline\\_recovery” using the LTS kernel.\n3. The snapshot one “cmdline\\_snapshot” using the LTS kernel as well.\n\nMy boot menu looks like this: [Bootmenu](https://imgur.com/a/rJVx1Nc)\n\nEDIT: When creating this setup I also wrote a full and fairly detailed guide/tutorial on it, just in case I needed to replicate the setup in the future and knowing that there is no way I'd just remember everything in it.\n\nSome people asked for the guide, so here it is: [Guide](https://drive.proton.me/urls/GKX84G630W#X49lqq0aYNYc) (I uploaded it on Proton Drive).\n\nEDIT2: As u/AppointmentNearby161 pointed out, only binding to PCRs measured pre-boot (PCRs 0-7) opens a vulnerability from rogue operating systems. A rogue partition with metadata copied from the real root filesystem (such as partition UUID) can mimic the original partition. More can be read about this on the [Archlinux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-cryptenroll#Trusted_Platform_Module). I also modified the guide to reflect this and to suggest a few potential fixes (be aware that I didn't had the time to test these fixes yet, so implement them with caution).",

I still tinker a little here and there, but I've learned a lot on the way, so the last couple months my system has been nothing but stable.

This issue happened after that with `20250613.12fe085f-6`\n\nTL;DR: after the manual intervention that updated linux-firmware-amdgpu to `20250613.12fe085f-5` (which worked fine) a new update was posted to version `20250613.12fe085f-6` , this version broke systems with Radeon 9000 series GPUs, causing unresponsive/unusable slow systems after a reboot. The work around was to downgrade to -5 and skip -6.\n\nWhy did Arch not issue a rollback immediately or at least post a warning on the homepage where one will normally check? On reddit alone so many users have been affected, but once the issue has been identified, there was no need for more users to get their systems messed up.\n\nYes, I know its free. I am not demanding improvement, I just want to understand as someone who works in IT and deals with software rollouts and a host of users myself.\n\nFor context: [https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/linux-firmware/-/issues/17](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/linux-firmware/-/issues/17)\n\nUpdate: Dev's explanation: [https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1lkoyh4/comment/mzujx9u/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1lkoyh4/comment/mzujx9u/?context=3)",

    "body": "As I was doing an upgrade for some unknown reason the upgrade of the pacman itself failed and left me without a package manager.\n\nNo problem - boot the ISO and use it to install pacman with pacstrap. This was a bit messy, because my root partition isn't big enough, so I moved the pacman cache to the /home partition, but pacstrap wouldn't have it. Never mind, just remove the pkg symlink and make an empty directory instead.\n\nSo pacman is installed and it's time to arch-chroot and finish the system upgrade now. One small problem - I forgot to mount the boot partition, which resulted in the kernel going to wrong place and an unbootable system. Another small problem, I don't remember how I've setup the system boot. The system boots directly (only Arch on it), but I don't remember if I used a boot manager and which one was it.\n\nOK, time to install a boot manager. Just a simple one. Maybe I was using [rEFInd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/REFInd). I installed it and voila - a bootable system again. So breakage fixed. In fact two breakages - one caused by pacman and a second one caused by me. Now I can say Arch broke on me, btw! It took a few years, but I got the badge.\n\nIn the end it turns out that rEFInd was not the boot manager I wanted, because it displays a wacky boot menu. I replaced it with systemd-boot and now we'll see if I have a bootable system on my next reboot, which will be next month.\n",

So my dumbass thought let's format that partition from Windows Disk Management and I will install Arch on that partition and that was a huge mistake. \n\nAs I rebooted after formatting, I saw the grub command line which scared me a bit(seeing for the first time) but after searching online on how to boot from .efi file I booted into Windows, removed grub(after some online research) flashed Arch on a USB, booted into the USB and lo and behold I can install Arch now.\nI thought I could go the easy way with arch install but that didn't support dual boot ig or I couldn't figure out how to setup dual boot from arch install.\n\nActually Arch wiki is the best way to install Arch after 2 hours installing it for the 3rd time(1st install had mounted drives setup incorrectly and in the 2nd I messed up the Grub setup) it finally worked, booted from Grub Menu at Reboot everything worked fine, but wait a minute there is no Windows boot option in the Grub Menu because for some reason os-prober wasn't finding the Windows efi file, had to make a manual entry for Windows in the Grub Menu(prior research on where Windows efi file existed actually helped) and viola it's 3am(started at 11 pm if I remember correctly) and both Windows and Arch are booting properly.\n\n\n\nBonus: In the morning when I again boot Arch to install that quickshell and hyprland theme, iwctl didn't work(which it did in the setup) because it doesn't exist so again I boot the USB, mounted the drives correctly(I am good at it now) downloaded nmcli from inside there, removed the USB and now I could connect to the WiFi finally. Rest is history as it was smooth sailing from there onwards I still haven't had any issues from Arch except from caelestia-dots and quickshell which were fairly easy and minute fixes not really related to arch.\n\nThose 3-4 hours I spent installing actually helped me learn a lot more about how these software and hardware behave and is a journey I will probably remember for a long time.\n\n\n\nPS.  The caelestia theme is sexy, and installing Arch is not that hard I don't know what everyone is on about everywhere.",

If we help new Arch users a few things could happen:\n\n\n\n* More people will be using Arch (great for our community).\n* The benefits of Arch will be spread, by newbies sharing with others.\n* Newbies will eventually learn and may develop their own packages to contribute to the cause.\n* They may gain a deep appreciation for what makes Arch special (a DIY approach to distros).\n\n\n\nLinus Torvalds philosophy for Linux is free, open source software for all. Giving the user the power. Linux is great because it's more secure, highly customizable, gives you a great degree of control, and it's private. I'm tired of people misleading others, telling them to read the f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* manual (RTFM), and telling them not to use Arch.\n\n\n\nJust 2 weeks ago I successfully built my first Arch distro and it still has not had any issues. I used Ubuntu before, but switched because I don't believe in Canonicals' bad practices. If you are one of the Arch users who takes time to help newbies thank you!

Many of the free written responses expressed a great deal of gratitude to you, and that gratitude is well deserved! Without you, this community simply wouldn't be, so thank you!\n* [Brodie Robertson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSyUvkpHv6M&amp;t=37s)! Thank you for showcasing our survey on your channel! It was unexpected, but thanks to your help, our survey had a significant increase in reach, and we appreciate it very much!\n* All **3,923** who participated! Without you, the snapshot of data we were able to capture wouldn't be what it is. So thank you for your time and contribution!\n* All who provided feedback! you've given us many tools and perspectives for use in the future, and have proven the value of community wisdom, so thank you very much!\n\n**Acknowledgement of Flaws**\n\n* Sample size: While we did see a significant sample, there may be variance when compared to the whole Arch user base.\n* Cultural / Lingual / Selection biases: This survey was only provided in English, to an Arch subreddit largely conducted in English\n* Self reported: We're taking everyone at their word\n* And others... Just know that we aren't claiming perfection here.\n\nBut overall, we think it was taken appropriately, and that the results are accurate and insightful\n\n**Explanation of Method**\n\nIt's important to know that not everyone saw the same set of questions. Those who expressed that they had not yet tried Arch were given a separate section, so as to ask them a more appropriate set of questions. This group was also asked many analogous questions to the main group, so that some comparisons could be drawn.\n\n**Highlights of Results**\n\nHere, I'll direct your attention to a few of the results I found interesting, but in the interest of both digestibility and letting the community draw its own conclusions, I'll keep this on the brief side\n\n* The posts we see don't represent the lingual diversity that's actually present on the subreddit\n   * Only **45.1%** of respondents claim English as their primary language.\n   * And **12.6%** or respondents reported an English proficiency that I would expect encounters communication difficulties at least some of the time.\n* We seem to have a wide, and fairly even distribution of experience. There are more users with relatively short terms of usership, but it does look like people tend to stay with Arch\n* Those who haven not yet tried Arch generally wish to use Arch in the future (**57%**)\n* The most cited reasons for not yet trying Arch are (in descending order)\n   * Setting up Arch involves too much configuration\n   * Stability issues, or concerns about stability issues\n   * The install process itself\n   * Happier with another distribution\n* Gaming compatibility is still a concern for **11.2%** of those who haven't tried Arch yet\n   * On the other hand, **77.6%** of Arch users report gaming as one of the activities they use Arch to do\n* KDE Plasma is by far the favorite graphical environment for both those who use Arch, and those who haven't yet (**36.8%** and **43%** respectively)\n   * Hyprland and Gnome are the silver and bronze medalists\n      * Among Arch users Hyprland has **26.4%** and Gnome has **10.8%**\n      * Among Arch Excluded, Gnome has **21.5%** and Hyprland has **13.2%**\n   * Arch users also have a noticeable affinity for Sway (**4.6%**), i3 (**4.4%**), and xfce (**3.4%**)\n   * COSMIC may be new, but it's already attracted a lot of attention\n      * **17.7%** of respondents report having given it a try\n      * **1.3%** of respondents declared COSMIC as their favorite\n* Kitty and Konsole were neck and neck for the favorite terminal emulator as the results were coming in, but the ultimate favorite was Kitty (**30%**). Konsole finished with **23.5%**, and Alacritty finished with **17.4%**\n   * I didn't expect Foot to be as popular as it was, and I apologize for not including it in the initial prompt. Foot has the hearts of **4.74%** of respondents, making it overall, the 5th most popular.\n\n**Hardware Breakdown**\n\nCPU\n\n|\\-|Intel|AMD|Other|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Arch Users (3798)|41.8%|57.7%|0.34%|\n|Arch Excl (123)|41.5%|55.3%|3.25%|\n\n* Others mentioned include Apple Silicon, ARM, \"I don't Know\", and responses reporting that they have multiple main systems with differing configurations.\n\nGPU\n\n|\\-|Nvidia|AMD-D|AMD-I|Intel-D|Intel-I|Other|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Arch Users (3794)|40%|31.7%|10.1%|1%|15.3%|1.98%|\n|Arch Excl (123)|42.3%|28.5%|8.1%|0|15.4%|5.69%|\n\n* For brevity, \"D\" indicates \"dedicated\", and \"I\" indicates \"integrated\"\n* Others mentioned include \"I don't know\", Apple Silicon, ARM, Hybrid configurations, and responses reporting that they have multiple main systems with differing configurations\n\nRoot Hard Drive\n\n|\\-|M.2 / NVMe|Sata SSD|Sata HDD|External HD|Other|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Arch Users (3768)|77%|17.9%|3.4%|0.5%|1.17%|\n|Arch Excl (0)|n/a|n/a|n/a|n/a|n/a|\n\n* Others mentioned include: Virtual, eMMC, Flash Drive / SD, Floppy Drive, Fusion Drive, and IDE HDD\n\n**Highlights from long form responses**\n\n* There were many long form responses thanking those who develop or contribute to Arch. There were even some saying that I should have mentioned something about donations in the survey\n   * I probably won't include this in a future survey *directly*, but if you're grateful for Arch , and wish to express some of that gratitude, the following link is where you can do so. If you can't, no worries, but if you can, even a small donation is very helpful\n   * Donate: [https://archlinux.org/donate/](https://archlinux.org/donate/)\n* By far, the most common long form response was \"*I use Arch, btw*\"\n   * I too use Arch ... ... ... btw\n* Another common response was those which expressed gratitude for the Wiki\n   * A little looking, a little reading, and a little patience does go a long way!\n* *my answer to \"my preferred way of completing a task\" question, is more like \"depends on how easy or annoying it is on cli/gui\"*\n   * I do apologize for the vague nature of this question. This response was included as an elaboration to that question, and I believe it represents well what the poll results were trying to convey. I'll try to give that question some better direction next time.\n* Some users expressed a want for Arch to support ARM, or for Arch Linux ARM to pick up support\n   * Given the recent direction consumer hardware has started moving, I agree, this would be nice to see\n* Many users wish to tell their past selves to \"*Take your backups!*\"\n   * They walked so we can run!\n\nAnd many, many more... I'll be reading through all these responses for quite a while. (Access to the complete set of long form responses seems to be limited due to volume. This was not set by us, and I will do what I can to make them all available, but I don't yet have an answer)\n\nThere's a lot more to be discovered in the full results. So if you have time, I encourage giving them a look! Please feel free to share your discoveries in the comments.\n\nWith that, this is the conclusion of this survey! I have so much gratitude for all who participated and contributed, so thank you to everyone. I look forward to seeing you all for the next one!\n\nEdit: Appending the [Survey Opening Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1hf7yda/arch_linux_community_survey/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

It was just for fun, 2 years ago i can't imagination how i change my OS from windows to some distributive at linux. 2 weaks ago i go buy new ssd disk for arch, because i want leave my OS at windows at second disk, I need some programs which exists only at windows. Before downloading arch I'm tried use WSL, but it was not good, i dont enjoy it. But moment, when i bought new disk and download my first distro in my life and how i know arch mark as hard distro for new, this was perfect. My first login in system was a good, but one moment. My second monitor have problems, my GHZ was 60 and when I changed, that was 60 GHZ. I had the opportunity to change my GHZ and I click save, but any changes. So, my friends say: \"You have a problems with drivers, fix this\". I go to fix. Maybe I spent one day for fix and right now my second monitor work good, without any problem. When I'm fix, maybe I removed some driver and my second monitor did't work. After i start work with Vs code and i had also some problems, because more extantions don't find if I download vs code from official website, but i can find more extanstions if I download from software store, but I can't use yarn or something else. I find solution just download with yay. It's helped me. \n\nI'm moved to arch beacuse windows have many useless updates, which eat my GB at ssd disk. And system was slow for coding, because many trash was downloaded at my pc, from me and from windows. I'm never like tab with news or more trash from windows. I'm every time clean my disk, because updates have a big size (my ssd 220+gb) and every update take many GB of my memory. With arch i don't have any problems with sizes, I downloaded at my system only things, which i need. I don't see any news every launch, i don't see any updates and crashes. Windows have a good sides also, but arch I liked more then windows. Perhaps not much time for my review, but I think its okay. I use this system just for coding, but this coding became a comfortable at 100%\n\nMaybe someone want also share own road to linux or experience",

I did not understand that I have to put \"root\" on the login, so I was just stumped there and kept reinstalling until I used my head and used google.  \n8.) did not understand that I have to use **sudo nano /etc/locale.conf** and the other instructions that told me to edit something in etc/ folder. I was just there stumped asking why the \"command\" /**etc/locale.conf** is not working  \n9.) did not install bootloader  \n10.) did not install efibootmgr  \n11.) did not install networkmanager or iwd  \n12.) did not search how to cancel a ping so I was stuck there for 30 mins just waiting for ping to end learned that I can just control c by just experimenting.  \n13.) put my country in the part where you /usr/region/city /localtime of something.

Fedora was just overall very buggy in my opinion.\n\nUp to this point I’ve stayed away from arch hearing that it’s impossible to install and use, ran arch install and it was as straight forward as any other distro, set up time shift with btrfs snapshots and installed an LTS kernel (because I’ve heard of arch breaks this will come in handy), as easy as you’d want. No issues, at this point I’m bewildered as I’ve set up a minimal system with literally nothing going wrong, (was also easy af using the arch manual) but then came the games, installed goverlay Mangohud and gamemode, no problem, played a brand new released game (Like a dragon pirate yakuza in Hawaii) fedora had weird audio issues with this game among other issues but on arch, nothing, perfect. \n\nArch was my last ditch effort at Linux after trying 10+ distros and so far it’s been absolutely flawless, the only thing I fear now is an update causing my system to break, but falling back to an LTS kernel or using timeshift should be the solution.\n\nSince I do not tinker around with my Linux systems I hope my arch installation will keep working for the foreseeable future, I’ll barely be using the AUR, all I do is web browsing and gaming and with fedoras freezing and audio issues even that was a pain.

OR if it fails to run mkinitcpio during your update, be sure to fix the config and re-run it or you wont be able to boot. \n\nHere is the forum thread in question:\n\nhttps://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=304822\n\nEDIT 2:\nThis deprecation possibly should have had a corrisponding news item on the Arch homepage to save us from sky is falling claims of broken kernel builds.

I would really like to run it on my Lenovo Slim 7x laptop with the Qualcomm Snapdragon processor. All the major laptop manufacturers are offering laptops with ARM processors. I've had it for 6 months now and it's a great device, the worst part is Windows 11. Qualcomm is just now finally finishing the driver support and it appears to be almost complete with 6.13.\n\nI hope next time, the drivers are complete when the hardware is finished! I've definitely complained on their forums and told them it's idiotic they don't start writing many of the drivers until after they release the hardware!\n\nI know you guys demoted ARM from your installations, but I think you should consider bringing it back. Between Raspberry Pi and these new processors, I think the number of installs would be larger this time.\n\nI know of the Arch Linux Arm effort, but it appears to be just one person. Maybe if Qualcomm sent you guys some hardware? How much would you want?\n\nRegards,\n\n\\-Keith",

My first OS was windows xp, then 7, then windows 8(hated that by the way), used windows 10 and 11.... I have used linux distros too in between like ubuntu and kali Linux in my school days. Didn't really liked ubuntu. I liked kali but went back to windows because games and other things weren't supported properly on Linux. I just found windows better overall. Now, after windows dropped their windows 11 i noticed my laptop got slower and it felt like windows was just trying to monetize everything by showing me ads and useless info. Taskbar was filled with bunch of crap i never used. I saw PewDiePie video of him switching to Linux and thought maybe i should try it too for real and not just dual boot it and then come back to windows and i installed arch on my laptop and used hyprland. It was Fun trying to figure it out. It was kind of silly using terminal to change my brightness, breaking it and reinstalling it again🤣 soon after some time i got some hand of it. Experimented a little with dotfiles then found a project on GitHub called Hyde desktop environment, tried it, liked it, and then just used that till now. It's been more than 5 months now and recently i tried using windows on my friend's laptop and mannnn....it just felt soo slow...like...using mouse to move my cursor and then clicking on apps to open them...yuckkkkkk 🤣🤣 sounds kinda funny but i didn't expect that using arch for some months would make me hate windows soo much...i couldn't believe I used to use that shit for soo long... In uni while all struggle to set up virtual environments for their python project i do it in seconds in my terminal. Everything still doesn't work perfectly out of box on Linux but still the fact that you can just fix it is soo amazing.. and now with all the tools like chatgpt, if you have any problem just copy all the errors from terminal and it'll guide you step by step how to fix it.

None of it was worth it, even though I loved the idea of a declarative distro..

    "body": "I want to make a minecraft server, but not for friends, for a big community. The server will contain multiple java instance (like 4-5), and I want to know if I should use Arch linux for a server.\n\nHere are my pros and my cons:\nPros:\n - I REALLY enjoy and know how to use Arch Linux. I did several arch linux installation, and if I need to choose a PC OS, I'll use arch.\n - I don't want to use Debian server, because it feels a bit old. It seems that debian is very stable, but that it isn't very well updated. I dunno if this is much of an issue, so please tell me.\n - I don't want to use Ubuntu Server, because I don't really like how Ubuntu is. For me, it's really bloated, and I don't like having a bloated server. Maybe it's just me, so again, please tell me your opinion.\n\nCons:\n - Rolling updates: A lot of people doesn't like Arch because each day, there are new updates and you NEED to check your server each day, and make a lot of maintenance for it. I dunno if this is much of a problem, so again, please tell me.\n\nSome people proposed me Void Linux, but again, please tell me your opinion\n\n(EDIT AFTER 30 DAYS)\nOkay so RemindMe bot just reminded me this message.\n\nSo, after 30 days (I guess), I got my server, and it was really good !!!\nI saw on htop less process than Ubuntu Server, but I don't really know if this is better, and if I just didn't make a placebo effect.\nPerformance side, the minecraft server didn't changed much.\nUsability side: I didn't have much of updates to make, once a week it worked well. Because I like arch, it was easier to me to use arch than ubuntu server, but if you like ubuntu server/debian, go for it.\n\nSo, the conclusion: Using arch as a server wasn't much of a difference; You don't really need to check every day for an update, but there isn't a really big performance gap between both.\nUse Arch for server if you know how to use it, and if you're comfortable with arch. Use Ubuntu Server / Debian if you're comfortable with Debian based Linux distros.",

    "body": "So all these lads in my life have always been yapping about how difficult arch is to use and install. So i booked a day of the weekend to migrate my laptop from openSUSE to Arch. Why not? I just finished my exams and i have little better to do before I start my summer job.\n\nIt was just a straight forward install...\n\nSure, you had to mess with some config files and partition some drives. But most of this stuff is things that most people have done before. I anyways needed to mess with the Fstab to mount my Sambashares and make users with different perms so my partner can use my computers without accidentally messing with my system. (or atleast lowering the risk). This stuff that I usually do after the installation, I just got the opportunity to do during the installation. Different, but not more difficult.\n\nThe real thing that I found a bit difficult was getting the boot loader to work. So yah, that did take an hour or so, I must admit. But I would not consider it too painful with the Arch-Wiki literally holding my hand through the entire process.\n\nI do say that I am enjoying Arch so far. I have felt like I needed to wrestle some of the pre-installed software in openSUSE to get my system working like I wanted it too. Which is something I am yet to feel in Arch. But other than that its just a normal working distribution. I have been scammed into thinking it was this super complicated integrates system of machinery lol.\n\nI guess what I am trying to express is that Arch is more mundane than what a lot of people hype it up to be. Which is nice, since what is the use of a distro if you spend more time configuring it than actually being productive with it.",

And so I tried to find alternatives, I found arch. I was a pretty big power user at the time and arch Linux looked perfect, I like my games and Linux gaming through proton has gotten increasingly better. I was about to upgrade my PC anyway so why not experiment? In a call with my friends I said that I’m done with the Microsoft crap and I left the call and immediately went to install arch. And post install it was just as good as I thought it would be, I started with KDE, downloaded all my stuff, transferred files and it all worked perfectly. Then for like a month I dug through the rabbit hole and tried hyprland, then went back to kde, tried dual booting. And yes sometimes the troubleshooting can be annoying but once I got to know my way around the terminal it all worked out perfectly. I can now proudly call myself an arch user!

Thus, after looking for what security things I could do, I went down the Secure Boot on Linux rabbit hole.\n\nAfter a few hours of messing around with shim and getting it working with the default keys, I realised I was still weak and not asserting full dominance over the machine, for this way I was using Microsoft's Secure Boot keys, which made things easier, but, Microsoft, you know? I use Arch btw, I do things my way, I don't want no Microsoft here.\n\nWith newfound energy, I went down the custom Secure Boot keys hole. I updated my BIOS to the latest stable version to have all the fancy features and fixes, and off I went!\n\nThis one far more interesting, for it involved figuring the keys out, which was a lot of fun, generating them, setting up auto-signing of the kernels as pacman hooks... Lots of fun stuff to spend a day doing.\n\nBut the final stretch was truly the most fun - messing with the firmware to get it added as an allowed key in the first place! The part that involves jank because your mobo's manufacturer added the feature in for UEFI compliance and probably never tested it!\n\nAfter ~~slowly losing my mind~~ bashing the keyboard in this one specific way, I figured out the idiosyncrasies Gigabyte wanted me to do to get a custom key enrolled and allowed to boot.\n\nSuccess! I did it! I achieved Security Enlightenment! No more pesky malicious files could ever be booted to possibly log my disk encryption password! All the security! I reboot to behold in admiration all the invisible processes happening to secure all, in my naturally optimised setup with 1 whole whopping second shaved off the regular boot time.\n\nI tremble in anticipation of all the power I am about to assert before this machine, all the security!\n\n---\n\nNo POST. Hmm, that's odd, I only set up Secure Boot with a custom key, no other settings were changed. I reboot again. No POST, nothing. I stare contest the motherboard's pretty lights. Bootlooped after a few seconds, huh. That's most peculiar!\n\nI start disconnecting hardware. Re-plugging cables, checking the power supply. All looking mighty fine. I take out the CMOS battery to reset everything. Nothing. No POST. Only pretty lights for me to stare at. I briefly consider hanging it on the wall as a decoration.\n\nThis is *most* peculiar.\n\n---\n\nI went to RMA the motherboard, thankfully still under warranty, and, surprisingly, it *didn't* magically start working when demonstrating it to the tech! Now that would have been awkward!\n\nA few weeks later I got a new motherboard, unclear whether it was a full replacement or a repair, however. I can henceforth conclude that Gigabyte agreed with me on this being most peculiar and very un-supposed to happen, for otherwise I would have been charged for the fix.\n\nAnd this is how the power of customisability and doing it all my own way has shown me I am powerful enough to brick an entire motherboard by just enrolling an approved key for Secure Boot.\n\n---\n\nI never shared this with anyone in writing, ahah, maybe this silly way of sharing it gets a few laughs out of you.",

Just a blinking cursor in the terminal.  \n\nAfter some googling, I realized I had to install a desktop environment (I chose XFCE).  \nThen I went through choosing which other programs I wanted to install with pacman until I figured out that some packages aren't there and you had to use the Arch User Repository and go through this whole make build process.  \nThen I discovered there was an AUR package to make installing AUR packages easier called `yay` (although I use paru now).  \nI got everything eventually setup into a usable state within few days to a week or so and decided I wanted to try in on my work machine.  \n\nTwo months later I horribly mis-configured something so that my computer was never able to shutdown and always saw some sort of `watchdog` message on repeat.  \n\nFast-forward to now, I am comfortable setting up a new machine with archlinux from scratch and have my dotfiles stored in a repo.  \nI don't need clicky DEs anymore and use `i3` (it's dope).  \nI don't rice too hard, just `picom` and a nice randomized background with `feh`.  \nI escaped VSCode and now neovim as my editor.  \nI also love/depend on `tmux` and miss it most whenever I am back on a Windows machine.  \nI never bothered with a display manager and just enter `startx` to launch i3.  \nIf I fail my password too many times in a sudo command (which happens embarrassingly often) I developed a habit of switching TTYs, logging in as root user and using `faillock` to let me try again.  \n\nAt this point I am still nowhere close to being an expert of archlinux or most things Linux related.  \nBut getting into archlinux helped me learn and grow so much more as a programmer than if I had stayed complacent with Windows and Ubuntu.  \nIt helped me discover my tastes and realize that was even an option on an operating system.  \nIt can look and feel the way I want it to.  \n\nAll that being said, I am feeling pretty cozy and complacent here now though and doubt I will switch to a different OS anytime soon :)",

GNOME has been rock solid for me, and I have discovered it is far more customizable than I gave it credit for\n* **Custom** **4K GRUB themes** → not only functional but also really slick to look at\n\nThe result? Easily the most stable and reliable Arch experience I have ever had. I get the same peace of mind I had on NixOS with rollbacks, without giving up the Arch flexibility I love.\n\nHow do I know I am truly happy with it? The distrohop itch is gone.",

    "title": "My journey from Windows to Arch Linux",
    "body": "After months of trying a bit of Fedora in Virtualbox, I decided to make the switch.\n\n\nI'm not entirely new to Linux, I have experience in using the cli because I needed to ssh to a work server to retrieve or upload files.\n\n\nThe reason why I wanted to move to Linux was because I couldn't stand how Windows throws ads at me everywhere, along with how much of a ram hog it has gotten (Have you seen how much of ram Windows can use on idle?). It also has the issue of forced updates, along with how the OS just \"doesn't work when I want it to\". \n\n\nWell of course it was hard to make the switch still until I saw Pewdiepie's video. Here I thought, \"If a non-tech YouTuber can customise all of that, I can do it too\"\n\n\nSo I decided to backup my important files to another drive, and funnily enough I feel like Windows could sense it's death is coming as explorer.exe when I tried to open the file browser. Worse of all, when I tried to restart it, guess what? Task Manager of all things crashed too. After an hour of trying to wrestle with this system, along with repairing the Windows Installation (Which was corrupted when I checked, and don't worry my disks and ram are fine when I did checks). I backed up my files and decided to move to Linux. \n\n\nNow at this point I was terrified, I've never fully left Windows before, but I thought the first leap is always the hardest. If things break, let it break, I have backups so whatever. \n\n\nThe first distro I went to was Fedora, I got it running but... Oh dear, Nvidia doesn't play nice. I got it up and running but nope, something else breaks. \n\n\nI decided to try another distro, OpenSUSE Tumbleweed. Installed it, it works... Nvidia again. I never managed to get Nvidia working there, and I got the issue where shutting down would lead to seeing blank terminal screen with just an underscore there. \n\n\nI tried to find solutions, but I didn't really have luck. I noticed one pattern however whenever I searched for solutions online. I always see Arch Wiki in the search results of Google. \n\n\"Arch Linux? Isn't that the distro with the hardest installation procedure?\"\n\n\nThe biggest factor that made me want to try is the community and the Arch Linux Wiki.\n\n\nI took the plunge, spent an entire weekend morning trying to install it. The full terminal experience was scary but the Arch Wiki is amazing on guiding through the whole installation.\n\n\nWhen it was finally over, I got everything up and running, Nvidia worked, all my sound drivers and WiFi worked too. \n\n\nI would like to say I appreciate the Arch Wiki, because they have the best documentation of pretty much almost anything on installing Arch Linux and getting it running. I am happy with my new system, I got a taste of freedom. No more ads, no more forced updates. System works when I tell it to work.\n\n\nIs it a beginner distro in my opinion? No. \nIs it good at learning Linux? It's excellent. \nInstalling Arch Linux is pretty much a \"I get it now\" meme moment for me. \n\n\nTo anyone considering to jump to Linux: Back up your files and take the plunge. The first step is the hardest I know but it's worth it. \n\n\nTo anyone considering to try Arch Linux: The hardest part is reading and following instructions, I cannot stress this enough. It's not the cli commands, it's reading that's hard. The world has made it such that our attention spans are pretty much like a goldfish now, and I swear it's somehow making us dumber each day, like there's an agenda to make us dumber on purpose.\n\n\nThank you to the Arch community, you guys are awesome. \n\n\nI can finally say: I use Arch btw\n\nEdit: Typo",

Whenever the RAM usage increases to around 5-7 GB, the system optimizes aggressively, reducing the usage back to 3-5 GB. During this process, the screen occasionally freezes for a few seconds. While I appreciate Arch's minimalism and efficiency, I have 16 GB of RAM and would prefer it to use the available memory rather than optimizing so aggressively that it causes noticeable lags.\n\nMy primary goal with Arch is to deepen my understanding of Linux internals and enjoy a tailored experience—not necessarily to hyper-optimize resource usage at the cost of smooth performance. I also dislike the stereotype that Arch or Linux users are only using old, underpowered machines. Many of us have modern hardware, and it’s important to ensure Linux distributions make full use of it.\n\nI’ve gone through the documentation, but most of the advice I’ve found focuses on reducing RAM and CPU usage—essentially the opposite of my problem.

Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away permanently unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because we love Reddit, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.\n\nThe two-day blackout isn't the goal, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.\n\n**What can you do?**\n\nComplain. Message the mods of /r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit\n\n\n**submit a support request** \n\ncomment in relevant threads on /r/reddit, such as this one, leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.\n\n**Spread the word**. \n\nRabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at /r/ModCoord- but please don't pester mods you don't know by simply spamming their modmail.\n\nBoycott and spread the word...to Reddit's competition! Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite non-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!\n\n**Don't be a jerk**. \n\nAs upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible.\n\n# EDIT:\n\nI have decided, after much thought to keep it at just 48 hours only.

    "body": "I just had the most ridiculous bug I have seen in my 15 years of Linux.  \n\nI was watching a movie in VLC, in fullscreen. It was a first time I've seen this movie. In one scene, the character turned off all lights, and screen went black. In the darkness, someone was talking, fighting, running for ten minutes. I was sitting there wondering at the creativity of the movie director, until I got bored and wanted to stop it. Then I found out that controls don't work. Including Alt-Tab and other system hotkeys. Ctrl-Alt-Esc saved the day. I started the movie again and found out that actually there is a video right after the black moment!\n\nSo, when VLC encounters a total black moment in video, it stops showing the picture forever (while playing sound) and somehow stops hotkeys from DE working. Only X server's hotkeys work. Further testing shows that it happens only on Arch (latest VLC version, I guess), only in KDE, only in fullscreen and only when VDPAU decoder is on and used. It also only happens with digitally made movies because only they can have totally black frames. Home video and analog tapes always have at least some noise. \n\nImagine the bewilderment I was in for the first time! Heh. \n\nP.S. VLC bugtracker refused me in registration, so I am not reporting it. It is a keeper!\n\nP.P.S. VDPAU, I mean VDPAU decoder. The Nvidia one. I always forget those names.",

Of course I hit them with \"I use Arch btw\", and when they asked me as to why I chose that distro, I said \"It's neat and minimalist while also being a bleeding edge distro\", and then they hit me with \"Well we're running Arch on our servers\" – these guys need the latest libraries and things like that, not gonna get into details. Needless to say, I got pretty excited about that prospect and didn't wait to express that.\n\nAfter a couple more questions I was told that they're gonna get back to me in somewhere around a week or so, we said our goodbyes and the interview was over. Then, some 5-10 minutes later I remembered about some aspect of the conditions or something like that, so I went ahead and asked the recruiter about that. Out of the blue, she hits me with: \"We decided that you're a suitable candidate for this position\" and all that. Having a soft skills interview on Monday, but that's more of a formality, pretty much like interviews with recruiters. Never had issues with neither former, nor latter.\n\nSo, what I'm getting at is it looks like what started as my little experiment to see if I'd like Linux more than Windows, turned into genuine passion and with a little bit of additional complementary skills learning – into a decent job, so there's one more reason to love Arch. To say that I feel on top of the world would be an understatement.",

    "body": "So, this is mostly just a thank you to all those selfless folks that put in time to maintain packages, update and maintain the wiki, and all the other things I'm not even smart enough to mention. \n\nIt's been about 10 years since I discovered Linux in general, and only about 3 since I've been familiarizing myself with Arch and the other distros out there. I've absolutely fallen in love with the idea of open source, community-driven knowledge and software. \n\nRecently, I've been dealing with a lot: I'm trying to finish my last 9 credit hours to graduate with my bachelors in CS, I'm married, I have a job lined up for when (... not if) I graduate, and I've been in custodial court for the last 6 years over my daughter. Last night I hit a bit of a wall, and found myself pretty down. Like, couldn't muster the energy to do ANYTHING, down. I'm sure some of you are familiar with that feeling. \n\nI decided I'd give a go of getting Arch installed on my new laptop, alongside Windows. I've done several Arch installs now without hitch, but getting UEFI working with Windows was something I hadn't attempted yet, and definitely made me a little nervous to try. I figured that, if nothing else, I'd be able to distract myself by working on that until I got tired and needed to go to bed. \n\nLo and behold, as is always the case, the Arch Wiki was my Bible. I had it all working successfully within about 2 hours of starting this little mini-quest. Believe it or not, all it took was this small victory to get me out of my slump. I woke up feeling optimistic and a little proud of myself for at the very least being able to RTFM, lol. \n\nSo, thanks again for all your nerds out there that make this kind of thing possible. Thank you for everyone who pours over the Wiki, correcting out-of-date pages and ensuring it maintains good readability. Thank you for helping me remember that there's always tomorrow, and that we can always find inspiration in the most unusual and unexpected ways.\n\nEdit: hey everybody, stop spending your money or whatever on awards! Just dropping a “&lt;3” in the comments can achieve the same effect. Regardless, thank you from the bottom of my heart for the love. It means a lot. If anyone ever needs a stranger to talk to about ANYTHING, be it work, Linux, girls (no promises on my ability to help there, though), depression, or how stupid the two-party political system is, please don’t hesitate to drop me a line.",

    "body": "I've performed a dark ritual experiment in an ***unsupported*** way of running Arch and collected real-world data throughout a one-year period. This is purely for research purposes and should not be blindly followed.\n\nTLDR: Arch has been rock solid and yielded 99.96% availability via unattended updates, and greatly exceeded my expectations.\n\nOne year ago, I created an instance at Oracle Cloud and decided to run Arch Linux on it. It's a minimalist installation of the `base` system, the `linux` kernel, the `grub` bootloader, and a bunch of packages such like VPN service. This instance is for the sole purpose of a VPN server. The total number of packages installed is around 145. I sticked to the default configuration as much as possible to minimise chances of generating `pacnew`.\n\nI was curious what would happen if I do unattended updates and reboot on a daily basis.\n\nContent of `/root/autoupdate.sh`:\n\n    date &gt;&gt; /root/autoupdate.log\n    pacman -Syu --noconfirm &gt;&gt; /root/autoupdate.log 2&gt;&amp;1\n    reboot\n\nContent of `crontab -e`:\n\n    15 20 * * * /root/autoupdate.sh\n\nList of systemd services enabled by me:\n\n    cronie\n    haveged\n    VPN service\n    sshd\n    paccache.timer\n    systemd-networkd\n    systemd-networkd-wait-online\n\nLast year the Arch installation guide still recommended `dhcpcd`. However, this later proved to be problematic for the VPN service to start correctly only after the network is up. I replaced it with `systemd-networkd`, and this has been the only major maintenance ever required throughout the whole year.\n\nI queried the log of the VPN service via `journalctl -u &lt;VPN service name&gt;`. Then I exported the timestamps of the stopping and starting of the VPN service, and worked out that the total downtime has been 2 hours, 53 minutes and 18 seconds throughout the last 327 days (omitted about a month due to log lost to a restoration from a snapshot). This is 99.96% availability.\n\nLuckily my VPS instance never got borked due to a new format of configuration required. List of `pacnew` files found via `cat /var/log/pacman.log | grep pacnew`:\n\n    /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.pacnew\n    /etc/locale.gen.pacnew\n    /etc/systemd/homed.conf.pacnew\n    /etc/default/grub.pacnew\n\nDisk usage has converged to 3.8 GiB while `paccache.timer` keeps the last 3 versions of each package.\n\nConclusion:\n\nWith minimalist installation and minimal customisation, it is possible to let Arch roll unattended without human intervention. Packages from the Core repo has proved to be of high quality. Hopefully this data provides some insight into building high-availability systems with failover relying on Arch unattended.",

We take that away, and that's how we get their attention. \n\nPersonally; I could supplement my needs by reading documentation, using Stack Overflow, Chatgpt, and [archlinux.org](https://archlinux.org) \n\nYou all are great people and I love getting involved. At the same time; there's a socio political battle for the experiences we have on this platform. Civil Disobedience or boycotting is where our power comes from. \n\nThank you all for participating in this discussion. I'd be cool if the mods lock it at this point because we all get the gist. I'm going to drop from reddit until something changes. Or I'm going to try.",

After you added the parameter reboot your laptop.\n\nrun **sudo nano /etc/intel-undervolt.conf**\n\nDecrease the CPU mV by -10 like this.\n\n    undervolt 0 'CPU' -10\n\nSave and exit then run **sudo intel-undervolt apply &amp;&amp; sudo intel-undervolt read** and check it applied properly.\n\nNext stress test for system stability as undervolting can cause a system to crash or hang, run **yay -S mprime**\n\nrun **mprime**\n\nStress test for 30 minutes, then decrease the mV by -10 for every successful run until your laptop crashes or hangs, once you find the sweet spot you can enable the undervolt service run **sudo systemctl enable intel-undervolt.service** make **sure** your system runs stable before enabling this service as it can result in an unbootable or unstable system.\n\n[Arch Wiki page for undervolting](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Undervolting_CPU).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Step 6. Hibernation Suspend and Swap\n\n* Swap makes memory management for your laptop easier,[\\[1\\]](https://haydenjames.io/linux-performance-almost-always-add-swap-space/) [\\[2\\]](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/do-we-really-need-swap-modern-systems) [\\[3\\]](https://chrisdown.name/2018/01/02/in-defence-of-swap.html) if you're worried about SSD writes I'll show you how to reduce swappiness or turn off swapping (not recommended) so you can use swap for just hibernation.\n* For hibernation to work you **need** a swap, I'll show you how to enable hibernation for a swap partition and leave the swap file [Arch Wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate#Hibernation_into_swap_file).\n* People using LVM2 I left a separate guide as it's slightly different.\n* Swap files on btrfs are also different I'll leave the [Arch Wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate#Hibernation_into_swap_file_on_Btrfs).\n* Suspend should work without configuring anything, I'll show you how to fix it if it doesn't work properly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo enable hibernation run **sudo blkid** and grab the swap partitions **\"UUID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"**\n\nNext add **resume=UUID=xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx** as a kernel parameter to your boot loader here is the [Arch Wiki page for adding kernel parameters to yours](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/kernel_parameters).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**For LVM2** users run **sudo lsblk** and check where the swap partition is located.\n\nNext add **resume=/dev/YourVolumeGroup/yourLogicalVolume** as a kernel parameter to your boot loader here is the [Arch Wiki page for adding kernel parameters to yours](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/kernel_parameters).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext configure the initramfs I'll copy and paste how to configure it from the Arch Wiki since it does a better job at explaining than I can.\n\nrun **sudo nano /etc/mkinitcpio.conf**\n\n* From Arch Wiki **\"When an initramfs with the base hook is used, which is the default, the resume hook is required in /etc/mkinitcpio.conf.

Wireless Card Power saving\n\n* From Arch Wiki **\"these power saving options are experimental and can cause an unstable system.\"**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nrun **lsmod | grep '\\^iwl.vm'** and make a note of the result.\n\nrun **sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf**\n\nadd **options iwlwifi power\\_save=1**\n\nadd **options iwlmvm power\\_scheme=3** or **options iwldvm force\\_cam=0**  |  depending on the lsmod result\n\n[Arch Wiki page for wireless card power saving](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management#Intel_wireless_cards_(iwlwifi)).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Step 12. Power Management Script\n\n* You can have an easier time by running **sudo pacman -S powertop**. I'll leave the [Arch Wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/powertop).\n* What I did is make a script to apply the same optimizations PowerTop does but I added more that PowerTop doesn't.\n* **DO NOT BLINDLY COPY AND PASTE THIS, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nrun **sudo nano /usr/bin/Power\\_Management** then see what you need from the lines (yes you do need the \"#!/bin/sh\" part) below and please keep in mind **the lines below are for my laptop specifically** so you'll need to edit it to make it specific for your laptop, which shouldn't hard and if you don't need to enable some stuff in this script like *\"echo XHC &gt; /proc/acpi/wakeup\"* don't. Not all laptops are the same and you should check what you need to and don't need to enable.\n\n    #!/bin/sh\n    echo XHC &gt; /proc/acpi/wakeup\n    \n    echo enabled | tee /sys/bus/usb/devices/{1-7,1-8,usb1,usb2}/power/wakeup\n    \n    echo auto &gt; /sys/block/sda/device/power/control \n    \n    echo powersave &gt; /sys/module/pcie_aspm/parameters/policy\n    \n    echo auto | tee /sys/bus/i2c/devices/{i2c-0,i2c-1,i2c-2}/device/power/control\n    \n    echo auto | tee /sys/bus/pci/devices/{0000:00:00.0,0000:00:1f.0,0000:01:00.0,0000:00:13.0,0000:02:00.0,0000:00:17.0}/power/control\n\nExit and save.\n\n* If your desktop environment supports CPU power management you can skip this part and move on to the chmod command below, only do this part if your desktop environment doesn't support CPU power management, keep in mind this can reduce performance. This part is going to be for the intel\\_pstate driver only and my CPU specifically, I'll link the [Arch Wiki page for other drivers and CPU's](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/CPU_frequency_scaling) so you can edit this script for your CPU and driver.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nrun **cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy\\*/scaling\\_available\\_governors** and make a note of the results.\n\nrun **cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy\\*/energy\\_performance\\_available\\_preferences** and make a note of the results.\n\nAdd the lines you need into the #!/bin/sh script above, If you notice your laptop is slow or stuttering after this put the power profile up till it's not.\n\n    echo \"your choice here\" | tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/{policy0,policy1,policy2,policy3}/scaling_governor\n    \n    echo \"your choice here\" | tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/{policy0,policy1,policy2,policy3}/energy_performance_preference\n    \n    echo 1 &gt; /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo | (This disables the turbo boost feature)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter you finished making your script run **sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/Power\\_Management**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext make a systemd service that runs the script on boot so it's permanent, run **sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/Power\\_Management.service** then copy and paste this in.\n\n    [Unit]\n    Description=Enables Laptop Optimizations\n    \n    [Service]\n    Type=oneshot\n    ExecStart=/usr/bin/Power_Management\n    \n    [Install]\n    WantedBy=sysinit.target\n\nrun **sudo systemctl enable --now Power\\_Management.service &amp;&amp; sudo systemctl status Power\\_Management.service**\n\n(For SATA drives only). run **cat /sys/class/scsi\\_host/host\\*/link\\_power\\_management\\_policy** if the result isn't \"med\\_power\\_with\\_dipm\" here is the [Arch Wiki page to changing it](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management#SATA_Active_Link_Power_Management). (You can probably edit it into the script).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Step 13. Improving performance\n\n* See these pages I won't write any guide since this is laptop specific.\n\n[Improving Performance](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/improving_performance)\n\nIf you have an SSD the [Arch Wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Solid_state_drive).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Step 14. CPU microcode\n\n* From Arch Wiki **\"Processor manufacturers release stability and security updates to the processor** [**microcode**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcode)**. These updates provide bug fixes that can be critical to the stability of your system. Without them, you may experience spurious crashes or unexpected system halts that can be difficult to track down.\"**\n* AMD or Intel CPU users should install microcode for their CPU.\n\n[Arch Wiki page for microcode](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Microcode).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Step 15.

Equipped with a 10th-gen i9, an RTX 3090 and 64GB of RAM (32 shared with the GPU and 32 host only).\nThe collegues were struggling in trying to install Linux.\n\"Maybe there's something wrong with the GPU\", they said. Probably the drivers weren't up to date, who knows. They tried CentOS, RedHat and Ubuntu, none of the bootables were able to show a video output.\nI was like \"Maybe we can try Arch?\"\n\n\"What is Arch?\"\n\"No we're not such nerds\"\n\"No Ubuntu is the best distro, if Ubuntu can't start not even Arch could\" (and this last one was partially true with the original bootable)\nTo install Linux was actually a strong requirement because the products we're developing need a native linux ecosystem and Windows is not a viable option, but it was the only way to boot that computer.\n\nOther two days passed, and no progress was made.\nIn the meantime, I just added nvidia to packages.x86_64 and run secretely a mkarchiso on my stick.\nWaited for the right moment...\n\nAnd the day after, some of them had a meeting long enough to make me start the bootable, wipe out Windows and pacstrap a minimal KDE installation. They came out of the meeting room discussing \"some viable options to start such a new machine\", headed to the computer.\n\nAnd then silence, followed by a \"WTF?\"\n\nToday another computer (a smaller one) arrived and they asked me to install Arch on it.\n\nMany thanks to Arch and the Wiki maintainers!",

Even though pacman keeps track of this information, it doesn't show it by default.\n\nThis can happen because of \n\n* using `pacman -R` instead of `pacman -Rs` to remove packages (dependencies stay installed)\n* makedeps stay installed after building AUR packages\n* packages removing dependencies in newer versions (without you noticing)\n\nYou can remove them by doing `pacman -Qtdq | pacman -Rns -` but check the list carefully first since  some of those packages you might actually want to keep, especially if your installation is very old.\n\nI've added all this info to the [Pacman tips: Removing unused packages](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman/Tips_and_tricks#Removing_unused_packages_\\(orphans\\)) section of the Wiki. \n\nI've also created [pacman-log-orphans-hook^[AUR]](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pacman-log-orphans-hook) which logs the list of unused packages whenever pacman runs.",

When at work, I plug it into an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse. On the same power strip as my charging cable, there is a small refrigerator. \n\nRecently, I have noticed that my mouse cursor disappears intermittently. It is still \"there\" but I can't see it. This only happens to the external mouse; when I move the trackpoint the cursor reappears. But I noticed that the disappearances were not random.

Originally meant to be a rewrite of yay, it's bound to be familiar to people of have used yay or other pacman wrapping AUR helpers.\n\nParu has seen a good amount of popularity and so far there's been 30 other contributors which I'm happy to see.\n\nThere's also been good amount of new features since the initial release. The notable ones being:\n\n- Print PKGBUILD\n- Print AUR comments\n- Print news on upgrade\n- Local repo and chroot support\n- Support for signing packages\n- Syntax highlighting with bat\n- Support for doas with `Sudo = doas` and `SudoLoop = true`\n\nI consider paru mostly feature complete at this point. The only things on my roadmap are [localization](https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru/discussions/424) and 32 bit binaries. Feel free to add to the discussion.\n\nI've also decided to set up [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Morganamilo) with some goals to see what people think and see if that goes anywhere. 5 poeple have already sponsored me so a big thank you to them.\n\nFor those interested in doing pacman/AUR things in rust. Paru is actually made up of several [libraries](https://crates.io/users/Morganamilo) which are in use in by a handful of other projects.\n\nThis includes official [rust libalpm bindings](https://github.com/archlinux/alpm.rs) for those who want to hack around with libalpm. There's also stuff for reading pacman.conf, srcinfo files, querying the AUR, downloading pkgbuilds, and dependency solving\n\nAlso friendly reminder that yes yay is still maintained.

    "title": "Is Arch Linux hitting the mainstream?",
    "body": "So I've noticed that in the past \\~2 weeks two major companies have announced their utilisation of Arch Linux *(for purposes specifically related to gaming)*.\n\nThe more famous announcement was *Valve* announcing the *Steam Deck*. As many on this forum might know, the *Steam Deck* will be using Arch Linux as the base for their own Linux distribution, SteamOS, with the intention to get *every single* Windows video game on Steam working on SteamOS via *(presumably)*, Proton. This news in it of itself is quite exciting as it has the potential of further legitimising the usage of Linux distributions for playing video games hopefully encouraging developers to pay closer attention to it.\n\nThe other, *and in my opinion more interesting*, announcement was by Nvidia. [https://youtu.be/VBfci5hYN1c](https://youtu.be/VBfci5hYN1c) They made a tech demo / showcase where a MediaTek ARM CPU was being used alongside an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti to play the game Wolfenstein: YoungBlood *(an x86\\_64 Windows game)* on Arch Linux (*on an ARM CPU!!)*. You can tell it's Arch Linux from the neofetch output. This was very interesting to me. I am presuming that Nvidia compiled their own version of Arch Linux from the source code on ARM although they might've been using the Arch Linux ARM Project. This means that they, firstly, translated the game's Windows API calls to things Linux can understand (presumably through Proton or Wine or something else) and secondly, the took a game that was designed for the x86\\_64 architecture and got it running on an ARM CPU. They also managed to get an Nvidia GPU running with an ARM CPU so this means they have PCI-E and potentially UEFI? *Sidenote: Nvidia's demo was meant to explore the capabilities of using RTX Chromebooks with ARM CPUs.*\n\nThis is quite interesting indeed and I don't doubt that both companies chose to use Arch Linux due to its flexibility as an OS platform with being very customisable and having the ability to be tailored to one's requirements.\n\nWhat are your opinions on this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: What I'm seeing in the comments has led me to believe that pure Arch *(given as is by the maintainers and the download .iso on* [*archlinux.org*](https://archlinux.org)*)* might not be the one hitting mainstream, but many entities will be basing their own distro's off of Arch due to its modularity and ease of compilation / customisation. \n\nI also forgot to mention *yet another* implementation of Arch Linux, especially on ARM, the *Asahi Linux Project* which aims to get Linux up and running on Apple M1 (ARM) MacBooks claims to be using Arch Linux as the base for their distro. Now sure, it's not being backed by some large company *(probably the opposite, in fact)*, but it's also an interesting use case that further emphasises the preference of developers to use Arch Linux as the base for *\"niche\"* distro use-cases.",

    "body": "I've become a systemadmin for my roommates. They also happen to be my family members. We all moved to the states together about 10 years ago. It's a huge family and we are super tight. We occupy a floor here in this apartment building. Imagine the Home Alone family just instead of a big house it's a bunch of apartments lol.\n\nAnyway. Many of us are PC gamers, particularly the 20-30 year old generation of cousins. (My aunt and uncle had 10 children.) While I'm not exactly going to say I am a tech aficionado I'm sort of known as the \"computer\" guy, I have an IT degree (although I've never put it to real use) and I have a reputation for fixing pleb problems on my friends/family's laptops and PCs. It is usually something simple like installing Windows for them in a very \"clean\" manner, a hardware thing, or just to look for a workaround for a bug. I use Linux myself simply out of personal reasons, it's been a longtime interest of mine.\n\nThe hefty majority of use AMD computers. It wasn't until very recently that the Linux lightbulb went off  for everyone else besides me. It wasn't even to fix an issue or for any specific benefits, just an interest thing, it has quickly become part of our lives honestly. It's been happening for a while but what started really kicking things off recently was I was the only one in this age-group of my family to get access to the new Counter Strike 2 limited beta. With a small crowd of my family around me showing off Counter Strike 2, my brother remarked on how insane it was that the OS I was using to play it wasn't on Windows. That one remark snowballed. I said \"Yeah right?? It's as simple as this\" and then I opened up Steam and showed the \"Steam Play\" sections of the settings menu. \"It comes built right into Steam for Linux, it's called Proton. It pretty much can play any Windows game, besides a very small handful.\" This blew my brother's mind and became a huge talking point. He began pestering me in the most wonderful ways \"Can Linux do this\" \"Will I still be able to keep that\" pondering things and soon enough we all began talking about distros, where Arch comes in. I explained to them the difference between rolling distros and LTS/stable ones. He wasn't interested in distro/OS that \"got a new version every months or year\" I said that a rolling release gives you the benefit of a system that you install once and update forever, at the expense of having to \"stay on top of updates\", ie system maintenance. I said that this isn't really something you can just explain or learn in one sitting, it takes familiarity and experience. But it isn't \"hard\", it's as simple as the idea of being aware of what's on your system. This part went in one ear, right out the other for him 😂 We looked over at the elephant in the room, which is a nearly 7 year old Arch Linux installation on my PC, and then back at eachother. \".....yo why don't you just do it\"\n\nSo there goes my brother, now a happy Arch Linux Plasma desktop user with his newly riced out panel scheme he is obsessed with (I told him not to change too many defaults but he just kept on going lol) it was so nice and surreal to see that obsession on someone else in my family, that I'm not the only one who gets the tingles from seeing OSs that aren't Mac or Windows. He opted for KDE Plasma because of the mix of familiarity, and instant access to Freesync support for his monitor, and the sheer amount of customization. I personally use GNOME but I know that's quite a bold interface I wouldn't try to push it onto someone who doesn't seem interested. The rest of my family began to follow suit, Arch Linux and KDE and Proton became the main talking point of 2023.\n\nSara's bluetooth headphones were literally the only issue and it was because they were some weird knockoff brand from overseas. Everything else works out the box, for everyone. I swear to god I'm not exaggerating, it has been SIGNIFICANTLY less stressful to be the \"little bug fixer computer dude\" in the family, since I switched us all to Linux. I AM THE ONLY GNOME USER, EVERYONE ELSE PREFERRED PLASMA. I think that's hilarious but it is what it is lol. Friday is now update day, I go to 3 different apartments and update all the Arch installations for my family. I want to make a movie out of this or something, life is fucking awesome. The only one who hasn't boarded this bizarre penguin train is my cousin DJ. He simply doesn't want to change anything, the tried &amp; true aint-broke-don't-fix-it type. He'll come around 😎🐧",

    "body": "tl;dr: In PKGBUILD, remove `--user root` and use `chown -R root:root \"${pkgdir}\"` instead.\n\nI found that some nodejs packages were conflicting with each other months ago, but I didn't look into it and just went with `npm install -g` instead of AUR.\n\nYesterday, I met the conflict again and decided to have a look. When I saw `/usr/lib/node_modules/root/tests/index.js`, my first thought was \"oh, the tests are installed in a top-level directory shared among all nodejs packages, so they conflict\". But I soon found myself wrong: how could there be so many packages that don't conflict with each other, if they are all installed in the same directory?\n\nThen, I noticed `/usr/lib/node_modules/root/package.json`. Oops, it's [a package called \"root\"](https://www.npmjs.com/package/root). In the PKGBUILD, there was an \"option\" `--user root`, which seems to be an alternative for `chown -R root:root \"${pkgdir}\"`. But, npm doesn't accept this option [since npm v7](https://github.com/npm/cli/blame/5ae068ae57d309b2ab4bc3f34c27cd1d86bcd7b2/CHANGELOG.md#L2885). Believe it or not, npm doesn't complain about any option that it doesn't recognize. So, `--user root` does nothing but installing the package called root.\n\nThere must be many invalid packages, I thought. But guessing is useless, so I created a new directory and ran `paru -G $(paru -Ssq --aur nodejs-)`. There were 356 such packages, and 184 of them contain `--user root` in the PKGBUILD. What's more, 291 of them don't contain `chown`.\n\nAt first, I commented under many packages. But there were too many. And this somehow seems like spamming. Then I decided to adopt orphaned packages. I only chose the packages that have at least one vote and the upstream is not deprecated or unmaintained for years. The result is the title, and more details are in [my AUR repository](https://github.com/ouuan/AUR-packages).",

I'm 100% sure the password was right, after like 30 min trying to understand what was going on, it magically worked again. Anyway I just didn't care, didn't tried to see what was source of the problem and moved on.\n\nBut today it happened again, not once but twice. Same behavior again, it just doesn't accept the password, and after like 10 min it magically accepts the password again. \n\nThe only output I get is `Sorry try again`. And checking the `journalctl` I found this:\n```\npam_unix(sudo:auth): conversation failed\npam_unix(sudo:auth): auth could not identify password for [myuser]\n```\n\nThat's what `jounarlctl` shows when using sudo doesn't work. Trying to debug this I typed the password wrong on purpose to see what does `journalctl` shows. And when the password is typed wrong I get this: \n```\nmyuser : 1 incorrect password attempt ; TTY=pts/2 ; PWD=/home/myuser ; USER=root\n```\n\nAs you can see, the error message is different. It also confirms that I'm not typing my password wrong (I already was 100% sure of this).\n\nWhile I was writing this post I decided to check `journalctl` a little bit more in detail, looking for key words like *password* and *pam*. And soon enough I found hundreds of lines with the following:\n```\npam_unix(su:session): session closed for user root\n```\n\nBut also, I found just a few a lines with the same, but starting with CROND:\n\n```\nCROND[18486]: pam_unix(crond:session): session closed for user root\n```\nIn these lines the error was comming from the crond service. Long story short, the whole problem was crond failing to execute a command as root for a script I had, which caused the pam module to kick in and block sudo access everywhere for the default fail timeout period. \n\nFirst I was writing this to ask for help, but solved the problem in the middle and since I already had almost the whole post I decided to change it from asking for help, to giving an advice. Specially for new users, which I see a lot of them comming in lately. Remember! always check jurnalctl when weird things start happening, It is amazing to debug problems.",

One of the questions that he asked was what DE environment am I using. Am I using a tiling manager or just windows-like WM. To which I answered that I don't use a tiling manager, stock KDE is fine for me. To which he replied what's the point of using Arch if you aren't using a tiling manager, stick to windows.\n\nThis statement felt very weird and dumb to me coz is he really trying to justify his usage of Arch by a WM which can be configured on any Linux Distro? There are many reasons for using Arch but tiling manager is not one of them lmao.\n\nTo the curious ones, I don't use a tiling manager because my laptop screen is only 14\" and it doesn't make sense to use a tiling manager for such a small display (for larger displays it make sense), at least according to me.\n\nAnd yeah, I didn't have time to make him understand this coz he was in a hurry.\n\n\nEdit: Ok, I was wrong, it does make sense for a tiling manager to be used on smaller display. I just never gave it much thought as I was fine with stock-KDE plasma and I didn't like dividing my display into smaller windows. (Max I like to do is use 2 application in split mode)",

    "body": "Since I've seen people [still discussing this](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/x8h9y7/is_grub_fixed/), [mods denying](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/x8h9y7/comment/inkgmgd/) the [clear upstream bug](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2022-08/msg00374.html), and even people confused in the [arch bug report](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/75701). I've the decided to explain the problem in the best way I know how: with code.\n\nSo we have a menu:\n\n    menuentry \"1. Arch Linux\"\n    menuentry \"2. UEFI Firmware Settings\"\n\nIf we select `1` we start Arch Linux, if we select `2` we enter the UEFI firmware. The command that starts the firmware is called `fwsetup`.\n\n    case $option in\n    \t1) arch ;;\n    \t2) fwsetup ;;\n    esac\n\nNow, this works, but the second menu entry is only generated in machines with UEFI UI support which happened to have booted into UEFI mode (as opposed to legacy BIOS mode) and in August 17 GRUB developers thought it wise to always generate the menu entry regardless of how you booted when you generated the menu: [Improve logic to check for fwsetup support](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2022-08/msg00169.html).\n\nThis has the problem that if UEFI UI is not supported, the menu entry will be displayed, but it will throw an error. So somebody had the idea to decide whether or not to display the menu entry at runtime, by adding an option to `fwsetup` which already has to check for UEFI UI support anyway (to throw the error), so instead of this:\n\n    fwsetup() {\n    \techo \"Starting UEFI firmware\"\n    \techo \"REBOOTING\" &gt;&amp;2\n    \texit\n    }\n\nWe have this:\n\n    fwsetup() {\n    \tif [[ \"$1\" = --is-supported ]]; then\n    \t\ttest -n \"$efi_ui_supported\"\n    \t\treturn $?\n    \tfi\n    \n    \tif [[ -z \"$efi_ui_supported\" ]]; then\n    \t\techo \"ERROR: EFI UI not supported\" &gt;&amp;2\n    \t\treturn 1\n    \tfi\n    \n    \techo \"Starting UEFI firmware UI\"\n    \techo \"REBOOTING\" &gt;&amp;2\n    \texit\n    }\n\nNow the menus are like:\n\n    menuentry \"1. Arch Linux\"\n    \n    fwsetup --is-supported &amp;&amp;\n    menuentry \"2. UEFI Firmware Settings\"\n\nOn machines with UEFI UI support, two entries will be shown, and otherwise just one.\n\nGreat... **If** you run `grub-install` which updates the `fwsetup` command and `grub-mkconfig` which regenerates the menu.\n\nBut what happens if you only do `grub-mkconfig`? (which is run automatically in many Arch-based distros), well then your menu is going to call `fwsetup --is-supported`, which doesn't have that option, so it's going to do:\n\n    fwsetup() {\n    \techo \"Starting UEFI firmware UI\"\n    \techo \"REBOOTING\" &gt;&amp;2\n    \texit\n    }\n\nSo... While trying to display the menu GRUB is going to reboot to start the UEFI firmware UI.\n\nThis is a **BUG**. Upstream has already [acknowledged so](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2022-08/msg00374.html) and are thinking on removing the call to `fwsetup --is-supported` in the menu.\n\nBut it has not yet been fixed in upstream: [30\\_uefi-firmware.in](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/grub.git/tree/util/grub.d/30_uefi-firmware.in) is still calling `fwsetup --is-supported`, and it's not fixed in Arch Linux either. All Arch Linux maintainers did was add a note saying people need to make sure to run `grub-install`, but what if you don't read that?\n\nThe proper fix is to **revert** these changes and return to a version of [30\\_uefi-firmware.in](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/grub.git/tree/util/grub.d/30_uefi-firmware.in?id=46d76f8fef7663b60d025cd425b348029c296350) which is known to work, so before 2022-08-18. In this version `fwsetup` is only called if you select the menu entry, never otherwise.\n\nI've sent a patch to Arch Linux maintainers in yet another bug report: [FS#75862 - \\[grub\\] revert upstream bug which causes GRUB to reboot](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/75862). This way it's not necessary to call `grub-install` to make sure your system boots.\n\n**Update**: My task was closed immediately because according to Arch Linux maintainers it's a \"duplicate\" of task [FS#75701](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/75701): it's not. That task was \"fixed\" by adding a note to run `grub-install`, my task is about fixing the package properly by not requiring to run `grub-install` and thus be backwards-compatible.\n\n**Note**: There are two deviations. one in the case your UEFI doesn't have a UI, in that case if you have an old version of GRUB installed in your EFI partition, `fwsetup`  is not available and GRUB will not attempt to restart to display a non-existent UEFI firmware UI, you'll simply not see the menu entry (presumably). The second one is that if you are on a BIOS platform, I don't know what happens if you run `fwsetup` there, but I've heard that the system crashes (instead of rebooting). I also don't know what happens if you run `fwsetup --is-supported` in BIOS, even if you do `grub-install` you might have problems, another patch to avoid that [has been proposed](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2022-08/msg00384.html).\n\nHere's the full script if you want to simulate what GRUB does in different interactions:\n\n    efi_ui_supported=1\n    \n    menuentry() {\n    \techo \"$1\"\n    }\n    \n    fwsetup_1() {\n    \techo \"Starting UEFI firmware UI\"\n    \techo \"REBOOTING\" &gt;&amp;2\n    \texit\n    }\n    \n    fwsetup_2() {\n    \tif [[ \"$1\" = --is-supported ]]; then\n    \t\ttest -n \"$efi_ui_supported\"\n    \t\treturn $?\n    \tfi\n    \n    \tif [[ -z \"$efi_ui_supported\" ]]; then\n    \t\techo \"ERROR: EFI UI not supported\" &gt;&amp;2\n    \t\treturn 1\n    \tfi\n    \n    \techo \"Starting UEFI firmware UI\"\n    \techo \"REBOOTING\" &gt;&amp;2\n    \texit\n    }\n    \n    fwsetup() {\n    \tfwsetup_1 \"$@\"\n    }\n    \n    arch() {\n    \techo \"Starting Arch Linux\"\n    }\n    \n    menuentry \"1. Arch Linux\"\n    \n    fwsetup --is-supported &amp;&amp;\n    menuentry \"2. UEFI Firmware Settings\"\n    \n    echo -n \"Select one: \"\n    read -r -n1 option\n    echo\n    \n    case $option in\n    \t1) arch ;;\n    \t2) fwsetup ;;\n    esac",

    "body": "I've been using M$ Windows for more than two decades. However, the user experience just got worse and worse over it's iterations, and the creepy telemetry built in Windows 10 is the dealbreaker for me. I decided once and for all to leave the DARK SIDE, and join the rank of happy penguins.\n\nThis is not my first time installing Linux. I've tried several distroes over the past decades, just out of curiosity. Ubuntu, Fedora, and openSUSE are the ones that I've tried with good CJK language support. I also tried Manjaro and MXLinux, but their CJK input method support is not functionally complete, and this is a no-go for me, as I'm Asian. Anyway, I've never used any of them long enough to replace my workflow on M$ Windows. And my skill in Linux command line was near to none, just a noob.\n\nThis time, it's for real. Initially I wanted to try using Fedora Linux for an extended period to get myself acclimated to the Linux DE, command line and workflow, as Fedora was the distro that's a little bit harder than Ubuntu, but not scarily hard. However, I have three hard drives and one SSD installed in my desktop PC, and I'd like to use three HDDs as a single LV (it wasn't too bad to use them separately under Windows as different drives). During installation, I found that there is no easy way to install the EFI and /root on the SSD, while setup a LV comprised of three HDDs and mount it correctly in Fedora's GUI installer. I found little information on this for Fedora during googling, but I found a lot of information and tutorial for Arch Linux.\n\nI've heard that Arch is an \"advanced\" distro, and thus never considered it as an option in the past. But since there are so many documents on Arch website and video tutorials on Youtube, I decided to give it a try. It surely was a little bit scary to see an black prompt rather than colorful graphical installer, but I tried to follow the documents and tutorials relevant to my scenario. So, a noob is installing Arch. Ouch! \n\nThe first installation was successful. I didn't bother try to build a LV, just installed it on a single SSD, with the simplest partition scheme and GRUB as bootloader. Just copy every step from YT tutorial videos, it's totally doable. Then I tried to use btrfs but not ext4 for root partition, and also created a LV and mounted it during installation. I was able to boot it with GRUB, but I made the swap partition too large, 8G for a system with 32G RAM, which makes no sense (of course, I reached that conclusion by more reading and watching more video tutorials.) I was a little too confident at that moment, tried another new installation with swapfile on btrfs. O boy, that was laborious and I didn't set up systemd-boot correctly, thus a total failure. GRUB was able to recognize the efi, but still hanged some point during systemd. For the fourth time, I did a btrfs install with no swap, created a LVM and mounted it, and using systemd-boot as bootloader. The fourth installation was a mixed-bag. I installed two kernels, 5.10 LTS and 5.11. I can boot with 5.10 LTS kernel and install desktop environment, but not with 5.11. 5.11 hangs during systemd, prompted me an error message of not being able to initialize LV and not being able to mount it to its mount point, then goes into emergency shell.\n\nAt this point, I've typed more commands in four days than the past two decades combined. Although I still can't figure out what is the reason that 5.10LTS kernel boots but 5.11 doesn't, but I think I'll just settle down for now as I'm too tired for another round of installation, and start using Arch Linux as my daily driver. Manually generate locale also provide CJK language input support on par with Fedora/Ubuntu/openSUSE, the three distroes with respective commercial versions. Perfect CJK support is the prerequisite of a working machine for me, and Arch delivers, since locale is generated during manual installation.\n\nOver the past two decades, I hardly learned anything of Linux from limited exposure of distroes wrapped under GUI. But just installing Arch Linux four times, at least I learned how to set up a reasonable partition scheme using command line, and gained some knowledge of what was happening under the hood of calamares.\n\nFrom this experience, I think the fastest way for a newcomer to learn the basics of Linux is simply start right away from installing Arch Linux on a simple machine with only one single SSD, but not from using \"beginner friendly\" distroes. If I could complete the same task without changing my habit from using Windows GUI for so long, I won't change that habit under Ubuntu/Manjaro.\n\nI hope the next update of kernel could magically fix the problem of dead hang during systemd init. But 5.10 LTS is doing fine for now, and that's enough for me.",

It's apparently [fixed](https://github.com/sddm/sddm/issues/1471#issuecomment-1483814271) in the [`sddm-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sddm-git) package, but `sddm` proper hasn't had a release since November 2020.\n\nNate Graham just [announced](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/issues/91) that SDDM was approved to become part of the KDE brand in Plasma 6. Hopefully this means more regular releases with more bugfixes!\n\n    [Approved] Plasma 6 Proposal: incubate SDDM\n    \n    Being a non-KDE project necessarily imposes more distance and loses certain opportunities for tighter integration, like the kind that GNOME has with their GDM login manager. It would be of long-term benefit to tighten integration between SDDM and Plasma to improve the UX in a way that incubation within KDE could achieve.\n    \n    At this point nearly all SDDM development comes from KDE devs anyway, so it's already sort of de facto incubated in all but name and release schedule. On that subject, being a part of presumably the Plasma release cycle would also ensure that SDDM gets regular releases, which it is desperately in need of.\n    \n    Obviously we would need to talk with the prior maintainer Pier Luigi Fiorini about this.",

    "body": "So first of all, I'm an idiot. I unironically bought a new Macbook Pro in 2017. I know, I know. I should have known better. In 2015 I daily drove Ubuntu on an old Dell laptop and that experience was less than pleasant. I walked away thinking, \"I'll keep my Ubuntu servers, but the desktop is just too much of a headache.\"\n\nFast foward to 2018. I get a once in a lifetime chance to visit a foreign country with my dad. No way I'm bringing a $2500 laptop with me, so I bought one of the 2011 Lenovo no HDD specials on eBay, threw a SSD in there, and installed Pop!_OS. Sure as hell wasn't going to run Windows.\n\nAfter we checked into a hotel, my dad asked to use the laptop to check his emails, the news, etc. He commented how nice the computer was, \"Where did you get this?\" Lol. I had to agree, it was really nice to use, and even though it was 1/10th the price of my Fruit-adjacent laptop, when I took it home, I started using it more than the other, and I thought to myself, \n\n\"I'll never buy another Mac or Windows PC again, it'll be something Linux based. I need to incrementally change my workflow now so that when that day comes, I'm ready to switch full time.\"\n\nAs nice as Pop!_OS was at the time, I thought it was important to expand my understanding of what was available, so I started distro hopping. Initially, I kept hearing people on Reddit and on various forums talk about how much they loved XFCE, so I started there with Xubuntu. I tried Mint, Ubuntu MATE, Deepin, and a few more, and started to notice everything was Ubuntu based. At the time, the other talked-up and popular distro was Manjaro, and when I tried that, everything changed for me. I had the choice between 3 different Desktop Environments out of the box. It was easy to set up graphics drivers, and change the kernel. Something about pacman I liked a lot more than apt. \n\nHere comes this year. I have 6 children and all told, 3 desktops and 3 laptops that run on Manjaro for our family to use for school and to game together. To some degree, I'm a bona-fide Manjaro fanboy at this point. But, as time went on, I started to notice some disadvantages to it, and the additional overhead of having everything done for you, which is of course a big pro in a lot of ways, but also meant all the systems came with a lot of extra configuration just to brand it as Manjaro and give it the \"Manjaro\" experience. I was longing for a more \"stock\" Arch experience, but doubted my own abilities.\n\nWell, about a year later, I gave it a try, just followed the installation guide, and darn if plain old Arch doesn't run even better than the Manjaro machines, the other nice thing was only dealing with things I had explicitly installed myself, which made configuration and debugging way easier.\n\nSo, I shouldn't have doubted myself. And, I shouldn't have doubted you either, Arch.",

Like many, I started my Linux journey with Ubuntu (version 7.10 \"Gutsy Gibbon\" - feels like a lifetime ago) and I stayed in the Debian family for many years, mostly on Linux Mint. I did distro hop and even go back to Windows for a while but always came back to the familiar ecosystem centered on dpkg and apt/apt-get/aptitude. It was only last year that I changed my daily driver to Manjaro, then EndeavourOS, and finally Arch Linux itself.\n\nI never thought apt was slow until I tried pacman. It was a hell of a lot better than managing software on Windows! Well, now it's It's been over a year since I switched but I'm still blown away by how quickly pacman installs packages. I\\`m not talking about download speeds, but the installation itself. Apart from when running dkms hooks for a new kernel, pacman installs packages amazingly fast compared to apt, which is very sluggish by comparison. What is the secret? Does it have something to do with how the packages are compressed, or is it configured to make better use of multiple cores, or something else? I really want to know. And if it's possible to be this fast, how come the apt devs haven't implemented the necessary changes to their package manager? What am I missing?",

I've tried to move to Linux several times, and I don't know why I hated Ubuntu the 3 times I've used it.\n\nI went to the Steamdeck subreddit a couple of times and I spoke about how much I like Windows (I still do) and how much Linux sucks in gaming and the fact that only 1% of Steam player's base is on Linux.\n\nI have a project that I should start tomorrow or on Tuesday to compare current gaming on Linux to Windows, this will also allow me to compare current Linux gaming to future SteamOS + updated proton.\n\nTo my surprise, I actually like Arch a lot after experimenting a bit and I'm even considering removing Windows all together in the future (after my project), or leave it for future testing. I must admit that I don't understand all the commands I've used, and there are so many ways to install things that some times I can't follow some tutorials and I don't even understand why (you are told to write \"X\" command that should give you certain output and I get an error :P)\n\nAll this said, it is a shame that Linux doesn't get the attention it deserves, it should be the superior platform in all areas (and in some areas is, like servers) but on the consumer side is missing support from developers, specially big ones. I hope Valve keeps pushing Linux and helps to improve gaming even more. The more people use Linux, the bigger the incentive for companies to support Linux will be.\n\nAnd I'm sorry for my comments towards Linux, it's actually cool. All this said, Windows is extremely easy compared to Linux, which I understand it makes many people hesitant of using it. In my case I've used Windows since 3.1, so I'm comfortable with it and I know how to solve most of the problems people use to have with the platform. But even installing vanilla arch from 0 wasn't extremely difficult with so much information available as opposed as when I've tried Ubuntu in the past.",

I ended up discovering a bug that occurs during a long lived series of interactions with an external API. The bug takes a long time to reproduce (~40 minutes). It was getting late, so I added some logging and left the application running when I went to bed. I woke up today to find that Windows had restarted itself to do more updates without my consent. It also helpfully tried to make Edge my default browser, bugged me to sign up for a Microsoft account (I have one for dev purposes already anyway, but why do I need to log in before entering my desktop environment).

This means that fstab mis-ordering is solved by systemd's dependency resolution, preventing a whole category of mis-configurations (loopback mount to file on partition mounted later: fixed. Accidentally wrote up mounting your games disk before your home partition: fixed.)\n\nIt just seems no matter what I need to do in linux, systemd is ready to assist me.
