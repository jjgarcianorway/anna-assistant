    "title": "I dumped Omarchy and went back to a fresh un-opinionated Arch",
    "body": "I gave it about 63 days before I gave up on it. 60 days ago I thought it was awesome. The past 2 weeks it was just annoying. When it became a bootable iso image I was pretty sure they were going to lose me. I didn't want a new distro. I wanted Arch with a a preconfigured Hyprland and development environment.\n\nI think it is kind of funny/sad how the mindset is is break free from your Mac and then they give you a version of Arch that is becoming more and more Mac like in the sense that you need to use Alacritty if you want these tui's to work right, and their modified chromium if you want these web apps to work right. And, oh I see you changed your keybinds, we're going to just change those back even though you did it the way we suggested. DHH has come up with some newer ones and you'll probably like them better than yours.  What? It changes your whole workflow? Funny you should mention that because we're also going to replace your neovim settings too. You might as well just do things our way.\n\nYeah I know it is an opinionated install, I didn't realize it was going to be opinionated updates as well. Just not for me. I did get some benefit from using it. I discovered lazygit and a few other terminal based applications.\n\nSo now that I am back to a fresh Arch install I figured I would give Cosmic a go. I must say I am pretty impressed with it. I like being able to set tiling or floating per work space.\n\n\\*edit\\*\n\nI had a 2nd PC with Omarchy installed, a little HP Mini. I ended up removing Omarchy tonight and keeping my Arch install by doing the following steps.\n\nDisable the Omarchy seamless login service and renable tty1\n\n    sudo systemctl stop omarchy-seamless-login.service\n    sudo systemctl daemon-reload \n    sudo systemctl start getty@tty1.service\n\nIt is easier if you log in on tty2 (ctrl-alt f2) to do this, When you stop the seamless login service it might kick you to a black screen. Once you get rid of the auto login you can also remove the omarchy decryption graphic and replace it with something prettier. You only need to do this if you are using an encrypted disk. If you aren't using LUKS just skip to the .config folder part.\n\n\"plymouth-set-default-theme -l\" will show a list of the themes. I went with bgrt which is basically the spinner theme with your bios or PC manufacturer's boot logo. You need to make sure you specify the -R flag so it will rebuild the initramfs.\n\n    sudo plymouth-set-default-theme -R bgrt\n\nAt this stage I decided to just move my .config folder and start with a fresh one. You don't have to do this part. If you decide to keep your .config folder and keep hyprland, there is a pretty good chance it will get updated back to omarchy again.\n\n    cd \n    mv .config/ .config.bak \n    mkdir .config\n\nThen I just copied over folders I wanted to preserve and omitted things I didn't mind rebuilding from scratch. Below are just some examples. One thing of note. Omarchy symlinks the themes to a lot of their stuff so if you copy nvim or any of your terminal customizations you might want to consider copying the omarchy folder. At the time of writing this, it only has a themes folder and a current theme folder.\n\n    cd .config\n    cp -r ../.config.bak/chromium .\n    cp -r ../.config.bak/retroarch .\n    cp -r ../.config.bak/nvim .\n\nYou can reboot here. You should get a new plymouth screen with the Arch logo at the bottom and whatever theme you picked\n\nFinally you need to get rid of the omarchy mirror and update your mirror list.\n\n    sudo nvim /etc/pacman.conf\n\nscroll down and comment out or remove these lines.\n\n    [omarchy] \n    SigLevel = Optional TrustAll \n    Server = https://pkgs.omarchy.org/$arch\n\nSave it and then run this to rebuild your mirror list\n\n    sudo pacman -Syyu\n\nAt this point you just need to do one more thing, remove omarchy-chromium\n\n    sudo pacman -R omarchy-chromium\n\nYou can re-install the real Chromium if you want it. Having the omarchy fork there will be problematic if you ever want to update Chromium.\n\nNow you are free to install whatever desktop and window manager you would like to use. If you install SDDM you can set that to auto login and go right into whatever you install.\n\nOmarchy is still going to exist in .local/share/omarchy as a git repo. I am keeping it there so I can cannibalize their themes. :)\n\nI hope this proves useful to some people and gets you back to just using Arch btw.",

    "body": "So I'm a 19 y/o CSE student, and I have been using Acer Aspire A315-58 for 2 years now, which comes with Windows pre-installed. I used to run Ubuntu WSL because I was initially a little curious about Linux and I wanted to do some low-level systems programming, which was really complicated with Windows.\n\nFurthermore, my laptop heats up very quickly when I just boot up Windows (task manager giving me ridiculous usage percentages), and I think on 5 different occasions, my screen just melted and glitched so I'd have to restart it or wait some time before I can use it.\n\nHowever, after gradually migrating most of my things to Arch Linux in May 2025, I can say that this is probably the greatest decision I ever made. Before Arch, I never imagined this would be possible:\n\n- Updating everything in my system with just a simple \"yay -Syu\"\n- Have a simple quick package manager that gets me all my essentials\n- Almost no stress on my CPU, GPU and RAM on boot\n- Everything I'll ever need is in less than 100 GB\n- No registry editor hell\n- No \"app is not on my laptop but it's still in my program list\" bs\n- Really high performance\n- I'm more aware about whats really happening to my laptop under the hood\n- Laptop doesn't heat up and send my fan to the damn ER\n- Custom keybinds that make me less reliant on my mouse\n\n...and the list just goes on, man.\n\nToday marks 6 months of me using Arch Linux (+ Hyprland), and I am very, very happy that I moved out of Windows. To be honest I only still kept Windows as a fallback, or when I can't use something on Arch, but 99% of my usage is on Arch.\n\nI really want to thank a lot of YouTube channels and the Arch and the overall Linux community for making this happen for me man, this is just awesome.",

My first OS was windows xp, then 7, then windows 8(hated that by the way), used windows 10 and 11.... I have used linux distros too in between like ubuntu and kali Linux in my school days. Didn't really liked ubuntu. I liked kali but went back to windows because games and other things weren't supported properly on Linux. I just found windows better overall. Now, after windows dropped their windows 11 i noticed my laptop got slower and it felt like windows was just trying to monetize everything by showing me ads and useless info. Taskbar was filled with bunch of crap i never used. I saw PewDiePie video of him switching to Linux and thought maybe i should try it too for real and not just dual boot it and then come back to windows and i installed arch on my laptop and used hyprland. It was Fun trying to figure it out. It was kind of silly using terminal to change my brightness, breaking it and reinstalling it again🤣 soon after some time i got some hand of it. Experimented a little with dotfiles then found a project on GitHub called Hyde desktop environment, tried it, liked it, and then just used that till now. It's been more than 5 months now and recently i tried using windows on my friend's laptop and mannnn....it just felt soo slow...like...using mouse to move my cursor and then clicking on apps to open them...yuckkkkkk 🤣🤣 sounds kinda funny but i didn't expect that using arch for some months would make me hate windows soo much...i couldn't believe I used to use that shit for soo long... In uni while all struggle to set up virtual environments for their python project i do it in seconds in my terminal. Everything still doesn't work perfectly out of box on Linux but still the fact that you can just fix it is soo amazing.. and now with all the tools like chatgpt, if you have any problem just copy all the errors from terminal and it'll guide you step by step how to fix it. Using arch has completely changed my perspective on how you should use a computer and how OS should be meant to serve you....now I can't even imagine going back to windows or use any other os like mac os",

I was about to upgrade my PC anyway so why not experiment? In a call with my friends I said that I’m done with the Microsoft crap and I left the call and immediately went to install arch. And post install it was just as good as I thought it would be, I started with KDE, downloaded all my stuff, transferred files and it all worked perfectly.

I’ve been using Ubuntu on WSL for several years now to access tools I use for my teaching and research that are a pain to get running on Windows, but lately I’ve been running into more and more issues which I chalked up to outdated packages, but is more likely than not due to my own haphazard setup.\n\nOn a whim, I decided to give Arch Linux a shot. After some amusing misunderstandings (where’s `vi`? …where’s `nano`? …where’s `man`?!) I finally have it up and running with current versions of my research tools. It feels so much smoother than trying to run things through Ubuntu so far, and I’m considering having my students with Windows laptops make use of it for my courses too (Octave and Sage for everyone!).\n\nAnd many thanks to all the folks who have contributed to the Arch Wiki. Pretty much all of my beginner questions had easy to find answers on the wiki, and the level of detail was perfect for someone who knows how to use basic terminal commands but not much else. \n\nNow I want to get a laptop to put Arch Linux on.

    "title": "2 years in and I finally feel somewhat knowledgable",
    "body": "So I had to nuke some harddrives (dealing with someone who got access to my google accounts, and potentially my computer(s), so had to go scorched earth on my setup.  Was painfully necessary unfortunately) and I had gotten more than a little lazy when it comes to security.  So when I started rebuilding my setup I installed Arch onto an encrypted thumbdrive and used BTRFS (BTRFS isn't the fastest solution for an operating system on a USB thumbdrive by the way) with separate subvolumes for the logs, var, home, and root folders.  This made for a great setup for snapshots, but I really wasn't considering the implications for when I eventually migrated from a thumbdrive to an SSD.\n\n  \nCut to a few days ago, I finally decide to buy a new NVME SSD for my laptop (I wasn't the only person hacked, and the authorities have been involved, so I'm fairly sure that this person won't be making any further moves moving forward, if I had to guess) and legitimize my Arch install.  I also wanted to get more space and speed things up--even with a barebones Arch install using Hyprland, the speed for random reads and writes is pretty abysmal, and I am usually doing development on my PC's these days.\n\n  \nSo I go to migrate my install and realize...this is a bit more complicated than a simple 'rsync -aHAXS /mnt/source /mnt/target'.  Having to recreate the filesystem, setup the encryption, copy all of the subvolumes, ensure that everything interacts with everything else correctly is a bit, well, intense, all things considered.\n\nHowever, after a day or so of transferring (good god usb thumbdrive's are slow.  Less than 1 million files and 220GB took literally 24 hours to fully copy) and a couple hours of setup, I unplugged my thumbdrive on reboot, sure I'd absolutely fucked up SOMETHING along the way but...\n\n  \nShe boots.  No problems, no missing anything, no hitches, everything in place.  Even my browser history and tmux settings are in tact.  Literally everything is there and everything works.  For the first time since I switched to Linux 2 years ago, I've successfully completed a somewhat complicated operation, with zero problems, zero issues, and zero caveats.\n\nI know in the grand scheme of things, this is somewhat minor.  But I just feel like I finally achieved some base level of competency in Linux that I'd spent decades at in Windows.  I did my first data migration when I was 12 years old in Windows, and while it's a bit simpler in an unencrypted Windows 98 installation than it is in pretty much any Arch Linux installation, still.  Just feels good.\n\n  \nAnyways, that's all I got.  Silly?  Sure.  But my foray into learning Linux started with Ubuntu (ugh) and, even though Arch is better, it's MUCH more intricate for doing things that matter.  I've only recently started using regex regularly, I picked up neovim finally a few months ago, and it took me almost a year to even try tmux.  Normally it wouldn't take this long, but the whole reason I began learning Linux was because I was getting into machine learning and trying to figure out how to utilize, make, and dissect LLMs and see what makes them tick--so it was buy a used Mac or install Linux.  Linux is/was the 'free' option, so that became my go-to.  I dual booted for a year, and only recently decided to go Arch only.  I finally feel comfortable editing config service files, and the only time I refer to documentation is when trying out new software.  I've learned how to use cmake/ninja/bazel/git (although I'm still somewhat novice with these, I can use them functionally), and I even branched out from Python to relearn some C++ and mess around with Zig.\n\n  \nI'm far from a guru, but I do like being competent, at the very least.  I need to learn more about the base programs/services that (most) Linux distributions ship with (like sed, grep, and others--I still just use grep for 'grep -r \"\\[search query\\] .\" and the like, ,or 'ps aux | grep' or 'lsmod | grep' etc etc; basic stuff), but I at least have a grasp on all of the different things that CAN be done.  From there it's just a quick --help or google search to figure out how to do what I want to do.\n\n  \nI dunno, it's just nice to have done all this myself, put the onus on myself to learn everything I have (I have had no job, school, or other outside influence on me to pick any of this up--in fact, I spent 90% of my free time playing competitive video games before all of this, so learning to program and to use Linux was more than a bit of a left turn all things considered), and it's beginning to pay off in some really rewarding ways.\n\n  \nP.S. setting up a tmux/bash script to display CPU/GPU/RAM/VRAM/DISK utilization in my status bar has been probably my favorite part of it all.  Customizing tmux is super fun, and keeping my eye on all of that hardware information keeps me from having to have htop/btop open in an adjacent pane while running various programs.\n\n  \nThanks for reading my blog /s",

I kept windows just in case I ever needed it but right now I don't think I need windows 11 anymore as I can't even remember the last time i booted into windows. So i am considering doing a full wipe and fresh arch installation. I have gone through manual installation but for convenience I am thinking of giving archinstall a try. What i need in my fresh installation are:\n\n1. encryption ( i never did disk encryption, i always sticked to arch installation wiki but I think encryption would be good moving forward ).\n\n2. Switch to systemd-boot from grub as i am moving away from dual boot. \n\n3. I used to use zram so there was no swap partition but later switched to zswap as I found out it was already enabled in Arch and used swapfile with btrfs recommended method. I plan to create a swap partition now and use zswap with it.\n\n4. I just want the minimal installation option, I will setup niri with my configs later as post installation.\n\nI used snapper with btrfs previously but it has been 4 years since my last arch installation. So, is archinstall good enough or should i invest a little time to know what's standard best practices are right now and go with manual installation for better results?\n\n\nEdit: \n\nI just went with archinstall script. Turns out, the script is pretty flexible and lets you skip part that you don't want it to do. I just let it handle the tedious part and did some manual work to make the installation customized to my interest. \n\nBut i do agree that it is not for new users. In my opinion, Arch should be installed in an opinionated way. If you are just going to install whatever recommended without much thought, using Arch will be same as using any other linux distribution. Linux comes with a lot of options and unlike other distribution, Arch lets you cherry pick each and every part of it. Take advantage of it when you can, use the wiki. \n\nArchinstall script is pretty good when you know what you are doing. ",

    "body": "This is for **Nvidia** users. I ran into an issue recently where my system would go back to sleep after waking. Really frustrating, but after traversing the journal and doing some poking, I found the solution and I figured I would share it for posterity.\n\nMaybe this is just super obvious for everyone, but (as a somewhat novice Arch user) it wasn't for me.\n\nSystem specs:\n\nKernel: **Linux 6.17.5-arch1-1**\n\nDE: **Gnome 49.1**\n\nWM: **Mutter (Wayland)**\n\nGPU: **Nvidia**\n\nDriver: **nvidia-dkms**\n\n\nVery simple fix. I found an older update to how systemd sleep worked, and it reads as such:\n\n&gt;The behavior of systemd-sleep and systemd-homed has been updated to freeze user sessions when entering the various sleep modes or when locking a homed-managed home area. This is known to cause issues with the proprietary NVIDIA drivers. Packagers of the NVIDIA proprietary drivers may want to add drop-in configuration files that set SYSTEMD\\_SLEEP\\_FREEZE\\_USER\\_SESSIONS=false for systemd-suspend.service and related services, and SYSTEMD\\_HOME\\_LOCK\\_FREEZE\\_SESSION=false for systemd-homed.service.\n\nSo.. I just set this to `TRUE` to prevent the race condition of some component settling or stray power event to retrigger the suspend again.\n\nI just edited the services `sudo systemctl edit` to prevent this against future updates:\n\n* systemd-suspend.service\n* systemd-hibernate.service\n* systemd-suspend-then-hibernate.service\n* systemd-hybrid-sleep.service\n\nI set what the template showed in those files, pasting in the appropriate area:\n\n    [Service]\n    Environment=SYSTEMD_SLEEP_FREEZE_USER_SESSIONS=1\n\nAnd now my system operates normally not going back to sleep after waking. Hopefully this helps somebody with the same issue. Maybe there is a better way to go about this, and maybe this wont work for everyone - I am definitely open to adjusting my logic here and seeing what I could do differently.\n\n**Edit:** So this works persistently. But, I found an edge case where even with this fix, I still have the system going back to sleep quickly after a wake. I think I’ve narrowed it down to application noise (in my specific case, I think it’s something to do with Spotify).\n\nAs soon as I zero in on the issue - as I am not sure if it’s specific to Nvidia, Wayland, gnome or something else, I’m going to do a write up on the fix and link the post here.\n\nIf you’re coming across this post, and your issue is _a blank screen on wake_, then this post is not covering a fix for that. Solutions for that are found on the [Arch Wiki - Nvidia](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA) page.",

I'm about to have a mental breakdown over this.\n\n​I've been trying to get a stable Arch install on my laptop for months. I've reinstalled this thing 10-12 times. Whenever I use ext4, it's pretty stable. But I wanted to do things the \"right\" way with Btrfs and Snapper for snapshots.\n\n​Every. Fucking. Time. I use Btrfs, I get random hard system freezes. The screen just locks, audio stops, and I have to hard reboot. The logs (journalctl -b -1) show nothing. They just stop at the time of the freeze.\n\n​I've been working day and night trying to fix this. I feel like I'm losing my mind. The time and stress I've put into this is uncountable.\n\n​Here is my hardware:\n​Laptop: ASUS ROG STRIX G513RC\n\n​CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 6800H with Radeon Graphics\n\n​GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3050 Mobile\n\n​RAM: 16GB DDR5\n\n​Disk: Micron NVMe SSD\n\n​Here is EVERYTHING I have done to try and fix this.\n\n​Suspected the Kernel: Thought the standard linux kernel was the problem.\n\n​Action: Switched to linux-lts and nvidia-lts.\n​Result: Still froze.\n\n​Suspected Drivers/Config:\n​Action: Fixed my GRUB config to actually boot the LTS kernel (it wasn't). Set it as the default (GRUB_DEFAULT=0).\n\n​Action: Updated /etc/mkinitcpio.conf to load all graphics drivers (amdgpu, nvidia, nvidia_drm) in the initramfs for early KMS.\n​Result: It looked cleaner, but it still fucking froze.\n\n​Suspected the Btrfs Swap File: This seemed like the \"smoking gun.\"\n​Action: I checked /etc/fstab and my Btrfs swap subvolume was missing nodatacow. I added it, turned swap off, remounted, and turned it back on. I verified with mount | grep /swap that nodatacow was active.\n\n​Result: I was so happy. I thought it was solved. IT STILL FUCKING FROZE.\n\n​Suspected the Hardware (Disk):\n​Action: Installed smartmontools and ran sudo smartctl -a on my NVMe.\n\n​Result: PASSED. The drive is 100% healthy. 0 errors, 100% available spare.\n\n​Suspected the BIOS/Firmware: I saw some ACPI BIOS Error (bug) messages on boot.\n​Action: Went to the ASUS support site for my G513RC.\n\n​Result: My BIOS is already on the latest version.\n\n​Suspected the Hardware (RAM): This was the final boss. I was told Btrfs is heavy on RAM and could be hitting a bad cell that ext4 never touched. I was sure this was it.\n\n​Action: Made a bootable Memtest86+ USB. I let it run.\n\n​Result: Pass: 1, Errors: 0. My RAM is perfectly, 100% fine.\n\n​So now what?\n\n​I'm just tired, dude. I've proven it's not the kernel. It's not the drivers. It's not the swap file config. It's not the disk. It's not the BIOS. And it's not the RAM.\n\n​The only goddamn variable left is Btrfs itself.\n​I'm a beginner, but I did all the \"professional\" steps. I'm just trying to have a stable system with snapshots. Is that too much to ask?\n​Is Btrfs just cursed on some hardware? Is this a known issue with my ASUS laptop or this Ryzen CPU? Am I missing anything?\n\n​I'm 100% ready to just say \"fuck Btrfs\" and go back to my stable ext4 install. Please, any suggestions from you pros? I'm desperate.\n\n​Arch on Btrfs hard-freezes. Already fixed nodatacow swap, on LTS kernel, smartctl passed, BIOS is updated, and Memtest86+ passed with 0 errors. I'm out of ideas. Is ext4 my only hope?\n\nEDIT / SOLVED:\n\nSystem is finally stable now — no more random freezes or shutdowns.\n\nThe issue was caused by having a swap file on the same Btrfs partition that used compression (compress=zstd:3).\nWhen RAM filled up, the kernel tried to compress swap data, which caused instant system freezes with no logs or errors.\n\nFix:\n\nBooted into GParted\n\nShrunk main Btrfs partition\n\nCreated a new 16 GB dedicated Linux-swap partition\n\nAdded its UUID to /etc/fstab\n\n\nAlso switched to the LTS kernel and replaced discard=async with fstrim.timer.\n\nTip for others:\nIf you face random freezes on Btrfs, don’t use a swap file on a compressed partition.\nCreate a proper swap partition instead — it fixes the problem completely.",

If someone has one of those cards and has installed the proprietary Nvidia driver, what happens when the new driver is released and a person updates their system through pacman? I can’t see any way that pacman would know not to update the driver. I do see that drivers for older architectures are included in AUR. Can a package be “frozen” so it doesn’t update and then allow for an admin to switch to the AUR package before a system update causes a system breakage?",

In that vain, I've found that once these packages are updated, the issue returns - they are:  \nalsa-lib-1.2.14-2  graphviz-14.0.2-1  lib32-alsa-lib-1.2.14-2  lib32-libdrm-2.4.127-1

That means I’m kind of stuck using the company-issued Windows laptop for everything.\n\nFor context: I work as a cybersecurity engineer, and I’ve been a Linux user for about 10 years. Unfortunately, I had to switch to Windows for work — and after about five or six years of it, I’ve had enough. I really miss my Arch + Hyprland setup and would love to go back.\n\nSo, has anyone figured out a good workflow for this? Ideally something that lets me keep using Linux as my main OS while still connecting securely to the corporate Windows environment when needed.\n\nAny tips, tools, or setups you could share would be super appreciated.\n\nThanks!\n",

This is useful after a large file copy. Disk write cache and swap both stay full and the system actually slows down. i don't know why Linux doesn't automatically release this memory after a large file copy is complete. But it doesn't for whatever reason. This set of commands dumps the cache and reclaims that memory. It gives the computer a bit of a boost. It's quite noticeable on lower end hardware.\n\nTrim: trims all volumes.\n\nupdate: updates repo packages and aur packages, the default behavior for paccache is to keep the last three packages in cache and clear the rest. I do this to save disk space. I can always roll back beyond that with the downgrade tool if need be. Updates snap and flatpaks. I don't' have any snaps installed. But i have that in the command just in case i ever do.\n\nInstall / remove: pretty obvious what those do.\n\nfind: searches the repo and aur for packages.\n\nbuild: tells it to build an AUR package\n\nClean: displays orphaned packages from both pacman and yay and prompts you to remove them.\n\nOrphans: only list the orphans, does not remove them.\n\nRank: uses reflector to search for and rank mirrors. \n\nAnyways. that's what i got.

    "title": "Advice for moving the kids' gaming desktop to Linux.",
    "body": "I have been using some version of Linux as my daily driver for more than two years now. For just over a year, it's been Garuda Linux. I left Windows mostly because I really am over the privacy issues with Windows 11 and I also detest being treated like a recurring revenue stream on an operating system I paid full price for. \n\nI gave my old gaming desktop to my kids to play games on the TV with and it still runs Windows 11. The kids mostly play games on Steam family accounts.\n\nI'm pretty sure at this point they won't care what operating system the gaming desktop uses. They care that they can play their games. So I'm down to two issues preventing the swap to Linux for the kids.\n\nIssue #1: We have a Quest 3 that the kids and I use infrequently. Getting it to work at all in Linux proved to be an exceptionally painful experience. I had varying levels of success with different online tutorials and it took several hours to get through that. When I did finally get the Quest 3 to work, it was still an inferior experience to Steam VR and Windows Mixed Reality, requiring sometimes significant tweaks to be able to interact with the game at all. For the moment, this is one isn't the end of the world. A lot of the stuff we play with Steam VR can be played natively on the headset though this does have the disadvantage of severely decreasing the headset's battery life.\n\n  \nIssue #2: Game controller support appears to be spotty. It could be the controllers. I purchased relatively cheap controllers from Gamesir. That way, if\\\\when the kids busted one, either through just not knowing how to take care of a game controller or via sudden rage induced mechanical failure, it wouldn't be that big of a deal. The problem we've run into is that getting more than two controllers working at the same time appears to be some combination of chanting the correct incantation and only using them during specific planetary alignments of Jupiter and Mars. Essentially, we can usually get two working reliably but a 3rd is asking a lot. It's not an issue we had with the same controllers on the same games in Windows 11. I'm open to the idea that the cheap controllers just won't work well in Linux and as my kids are a bit older now(13, 12, 9), I'd be willing to invest in some better quality controllers if I knew they'd work well with Linux.\n\nAny thoughts on the above? I'd love to ditch Windows entirely but I do understand that most manufacturers of hardware and software still develop primarily for Windows.  \n",

    "body": "SOLVED\n\nBasically, the reason i couldn't use wine properly and open certain apps was because i was using the hardened linux kernel...\n\nSwitched to the normal one and now rocking winboat with a microWin windows 11 install. Used the CTT debloat tool to transform a bloated, telemetry collecting win11 iso to an incredibly minimal windows iso and installed it onto winboat + ran the ctt debloat tool AGAIN to kill all the shitty windows services no one asked for.... Installed fl studio and now need a way to access my sounds within the VM without giving windows access to the home folder :D\n\n\n\n\n\nI've decided to switch to arch linux. As a complete beginner I understand that this is a risky move, but I desire to learn and grow through this journey.\n\nI had to leave behind windows because i couldn't make a partition big enough for my linux endeavor, so I decided to just install arch on the whole drive: I used archinstall, encrypted the ssd and I'm using the hardened linux kernel bc I'd like to bring some privacy and digital security back into my life (i did install and activate a firewall too).\n\nNow, I bought and I've been using Fl Studio for quite some time and after looking at a couple of wine tutorials, specific for this topic, I thought I could get it working. I did get it to work somewhat, but got quite a few errors and unfortunately don't have an audio interface compatible with linux.\n\nMy 2 main questions are:\n\n1. Is it possible to get it working, perhaps using a solution like \"bottles\" and routing my audio properly using carla (or something a bit more intuitive) in a way that works?\n2. would it be a viable option to dualboot windows on the same encrypted ssd without having to start over from scratch (which I wouldn't mind too much)?\n\nI'll provide some extra information if needed and any help would be highly appreciated...\n\nSome extra info I feel might be useful for you to know: running kde plasma 6, i set up timeshift on this partition using RSYNC, BTRFC file structure...\n\nI set it all up today so I will take all recommendations into consideration and I'm willing to start fresh and vanilla arch is not a must as long as I'm able to customize everything and make music :)\n\nThank you so unbelievably much in advance and whether you help me or are just passing by, thank you for existing!",

And then during the process it knocked me out of my X session and every log in attempt my screen would blink for half a second and I would be back in my login screen. I shut my laptop down and turned it back on, and I got an error message about modules.devname not found in /lib/\"xxx\"/arch and I was left in a terminal with my name replaced with rootfs. None of the commands would work like nvim or pacman, and I honestly have no idea what that error was so please let me know if you guys know what that means. I'm just gonna talk about how I got back into arch and how I'm making this post.\n\nFirst, I wiped the dust off my usb stick and got back into the live environment. I mounted my partitions with the mount command, and entered my system through arch-chroot.\n\nThen, I reinstalled grub. Apparently that's how somebody else solved this issue back in 2018 so I thought I would give it a try. I ran grub-install pointing to my boot partition and efi directory, and remade my config with grub-mkconfig. All of this went with no errors. I rebooted the system and now my Arch Linux entry was gone.\n\nSo I chrooted back into my system and used efibootmgr to remove all the useless entries and made a new entry pointing to my new grubx64.efi. It was located in /boot/EFI/EFI/GRUB for some reason. If anybody knows whether it's fine to have two EFI folders or if I should be concerned for the future please let me know also.\n\nAnd I rebooted, and everything was working fine and normal again. So basically the solution was to reinstall grub, remake the config, use efibootmgr to make sure my system finds arch\n\nHopefully if anybody else runs into the same problem as me it helps a little bit.",

    "title": "My Arch Journey ~ A Linux Newbie",
    "body": "# Preface\n\nI have never ever tried Arch before, and I am dying to express my journey to *somebody.*  \nTurns out, people get bored incredibly quickly when I start talking about arch :)\n\nSo this might be a slightly long post, please bear with me. Hope this might in someway help someone.\n\n# Chapter 1 - First Install\n\nFrom what I have heard the one and only guide for installation you need is [\"The Wiki\"](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide)\n\nI have read a lot of documentations, none of them as \"complete\" as this one. It has everything that one might ever need. It just needs to be searched thoroughly.\n\nI installed an extremely basic installation but I got lost on what packages to install. Getting confused with what a DE is what SDDM does and so on.\n\nI wanted to just get some sort of a setup started so I followed [this](https://gist.github.com/mjkstra/96ce7a5689d753e7a6bdd92cdc169bae)\n\nI have never worked with btrfs file system. But I thought I'll give it a shot. The author mentions that we need to create sub volumes of @ and @ home. (Which I completely ignored because I thought it wasn't important and went ahead with my 2 separate partitions for each)\n\nBIG MISTAKE\n\n# Chapter 2 - Timeshift\n\nSo now I got the hang of Arch,\n\n* Installed KDE, downloaded themes mix and matched stuff\n* Installed a theme for my GRUB\n   * (Also modified it using grub-customizer by removing unecessary entries and re-ordering other entries (Linux Mint &amp; Windows). Another mistake BTW.\n* Setup few other packages that I require and was quite happy with my setup.\n\nNow, I wanted to save it. The github author of the installation guide suggested timeshift worked amazing with btrfs. So I wanted to try timeshift!\n\nTurns out, you *require* @ and @ home directories since that is the setup timeshift expects (for reasons unknown)\n\nThe Fix:  \nI won't go into too many details but basically,\n\n1. Created a copy of my root partition in \"@\" via the btrfs snapshot feature.\n2. Created a new subvolume \"@ home\" and copied my home partition into it (Please note to use `cp -rp` . Don't ask how I know)\n3. Generated my fstab file again (Please note to remove previous entries in the file and not just use the `&gt;&gt;` as mentioned in the wiki. Again, don't ask.)\n4. Generate the grub.cfg file again (And as much as I liked grub-customizer earlier. I HATED it here. It does something to the files which kind of break the generation of grub.cfg, it does not go to the vanilla configuration. Please note, just manually modify the grub.cfg for your OCD instead of messing with grub-customizer IMO)\n5. Finally, system was booting and mounted correctly, I still had my complete setup. Now I just cleaned the rest of the stuff up by deleting the previous locations of the root and home directory (gparted is pretty cool too!)\n\nPhew,\n\n# Chapter 3 - Nvidia\n\nNow, the only problem that I was having with my setup (now that it was completely backed up), was that I could only run 60Hz on my monitor. From most inferences I see online, it seems that installing nvidia drivers seems to have resolved the problem.\n\nLet me just begin this by saying thank god I figured out timeshift earlier. So that I can make instant undos / redos here!\n\n# Chapter 3.1 - ???\n\nThat's a wiki reference for you all (the 3.1 get it?). Anyways so I started here: [https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA)\n\nNow I think I'll get some backlash for this, but to my untrained eye, this is THE most confusing of the Arch Wiki pages I have seen. (Totally didn't start reading Arch Wiki like a week back \\\\s)\n\nI got to the first step and installed nvidia-open and the later steps just confused the heck out of me. From what I could understand, I had to install the package nvidia-open and somehow set modeset=1 somewhere. I tried understanding the page for half an hour when I gaveup and just rebooted my system.\n\nTo my surprise, my monitor started working at 120 Hz right away! Big win right there.\n\n# Chapter 3.2 - The reboot\n\nI shutdown my system, came back a day later only to see that SDDM had not even loaded.  \n(BTW another note: ctrl + alt + f3 lets you login via TTY3)\n\nI saw the `journalctl -b` and saw some log saying \"nvidia-gpu i2c timeout error\". Still no idea what it means.\n\nI tried the following to fix:\n\n* upgraded all packages\n* Downgraded nvidia-open and nvidia-utils (Another note: You can use the downgrade package to downgrade stuff. Also note, you can specify multiple packages in a single downgrade command to simultaneously downgrade packagase that depend on each other)\n* Installed nvidia-exec (nvx). It did solve the problem by shutting down my nvidia gpu entirely so that the system runs on my integrated card. But that is hardly a solution (this time I couldn't even start the screen of my monitor with the integrated gpu)\n\nAnyway, nothing worked, until I stumbled upon this page:\n\n[https://forum.manjaro.org/t/how-to-add-nvidia-drm-modeset-1-kernel-parameter/152447](https://forum.manjaro.org/t/how-to-add-nvidia-drm-modeset-1-kernel-parameter/152447)\n\nWhere the user \"nikgnomic\" kindly \"spelled out\" how to set the modeset=1.\n\n# Chapter 3.3 - Sigh\n\nI thought it worked. However, just when I was opening my laptop to write this post, it happened again. Sometimes rebooting fixes the issue, still not sure about the cause of the problem though.\n\nPlease share any things I can try here.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis is the BEST experience of linux I have had ever. I am not sure why. Perhaps it is because I built it myself or maybe because of how much I got to learn along the way. I had tons of fun!\n\nI would highly recommend anyone who is somewhat familiar with Linux or has the time to learn and read to install Arch.\n\nLook forward to being part of the Arch community!\n\nLife update (5 Nov):\n\nI finally got Nvidia to work!! wohoo. Turns out, early loading of the nvidia modules is a must. Oh well, the more you know.",

So am the tech, my friend in Vermont calls me last night frantic cause his PC Arch just got messed up and doesn't know how to even begin to reinstall.\n\nI start talking to chatgpt.. yes chatgpt.. and it gave me an idea for him to open a port on his router so I can ssh to him on the usb live Arch installation. He doesn't have access to the router.. so chatgpt tells me to do reverse ssh, let him connect to me and then I can connect to him..\n\nSo to conclude this story, I don't know what F***$&amp;$ry of magic I pulled out of my A*&amp;!! But I was able to install Linux on his machine, from South Florida to Vermont or Connecticut some where up north 3 hours from Boston... partition and all and got him up and running, In like 30mins, with setting up the reverse ssh..\n\nWe both were screaming on the phone and the wives were like what is up with you guys.. and we were like: OMG!!!!OMG!! OMG!!\n\nI love this OS and the roller coaster of learning experience I have learned in the past 2 years, Microsoft can't get me back even if they payed me.. even my son yesterday after what he saw wiped his windows is and install cachyos and got all his games up and running..\n\nThis for me as of yesterday had turned into the god tier OS... the more I learn, the better it gets.. everyone I have helped is grateful.. everything just works!! Linux is one truly awesome OS.. \n\nYear 1 was learning year, you will mess up, but instead of feeling defeated learn from that moment, it's growing pains.. MS has brain washed us to believe that the issues it has is normal.. OS tweaks and it's not... In Linux you will also learn, cause that is what we do learn in life.. And once it clicks..

Would I also need to downgrade my kernel, or can it stay the same (as there were no ABI changes in the recent update)?\n\nI am assuming it is just `lib32-nvidia-utils` (580.105.08), `libva-nvidia-driver` (0.0.14 - irrelevant?), `linux-firmware-nvidia` (20251021-1 - irrelevant?), `nvidia-dkms` (580.105.08), `nvidia-settings` (580.105.08), `nvidia-utils` (580.105.08).\n\nThank you.",
