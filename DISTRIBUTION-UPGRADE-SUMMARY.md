# Anna Assistant - Distribution Upgrade Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow for Automated Builds
**File:** `.github/workflows/release.yml`

- Builds binaries for x86_64 and aarch64 on every tagged release
- Creates compressed archives with SHA256 checksums
- Uploads to GitHub Releases automatically
- Creates combined SHA256SUMS file for verification

**Trigger:** Push tag matching `v*.*.*` (e.g., `v0.11.0`)

### 2. AUR Package Manifests
**Directory:** `packaging/aur/`

**Files created:**
- `PKGBUILD` - Source build package for AUR
- `PKGBUILD-bin` - Binary package for AUR (faster installation)
- `anna-assistant.install` - Post-install/upgrade scripts
- `README.md` - AUR submission instructions

**Benefits:**
- Native Arch Linux package management
- Automatic updates via AUR helpers (yay, paru)
- Two options: fast binary install or latest source build

### 3. Smart Installer with Binary Downloads
**File:** `scripts/install.sh` (completely rewritten)

**New Features:**
- **Automatic binary downloads** from GitHub releases
- **Architecture detection** (x86_64, aarch64)
- **Fallback chain:**
  1. Check for binaries in `./bin/` (manual/offline install)
  2. Download from GitHub releases
  3. Build from source (only if needed)
- **Prerequisite checking** for Rust/Cargo before building
- **Better error messages** with actionable suggestions
- **Binary verification** (ELF format check)
- **Installation method reporting**

**Command-line options:**
- `--build`, `--source` - Force source build
- `--help`, `-h` - Show help

### 4. Comprehensive Documentation
**Files created:**
- `INSTALLATION.md` - Complete installation guide for all methods
- `docs/RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md` - Maintainer guide for releases
- `packaging/aur/README.md` - AUR package submission guide

## Current Status

### What Works Now

âœ… **Installer improvements:**
- Smart installer script with fallback logic
- Detects missing Rust and provides helpful instructions
- Checks for curl/wget before attempting downloads
- Verifies binaries before installation

âœ… **AUR packages ready:**
- PKGBUILDs are complete and ready for submission
- Installation scripts handle user/group creation
- Proper systemd integration

### What Needs to Happen Next

#### For Your Immediate Installation

Since you're on a new Arch system without Rust, you need to:

```bash
# Option 1: Install Rust (recommended for first-time setup)
sudo pacman -S rust

# Then run installer
./scripts/install.sh
```

**OR**

```bash
# Option 2: Wait for first release, then use binary download
# (requires maintainer to create a release first)
```

#### For Future Users (After First Release)

**When v0.11.0 is released, users can install WITHOUT Rust:**

```bash
# Clone and run - downloads pre-compiled binaries automatically
git clone https://github.com/jjgarcianorway/anna-assistant.git
cd anna-assistant
./scripts/install.sh  # No Rust needed!
```

## Release Process (For Maintainer)

To enable binary downloads for all users:

### Step 1: Create Release Tag

```bash
# Ensure version is correct in all files
grep -r "0.11.0" Cargo.toml scripts/install.sh packaging/aur/

# Commit any pending changes
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: prepare for v0.11.0 release"

# Create and push tag
git tag -a v0.11.0 -m "Release v0.11.0 - Binary distribution support"
git push origin main
git push origin v0.11.0
```

### Step 2: Wait for GitHub Actions

- GitHub Actions will automatically:
  1. Build binaries for x86_64 and aarch64
  2. Create release on GitHub
  3. Upload binaries and checksums

- Monitor at: https://github.com/jjgarcianorway/anna-assistant/actions

### Step 3: Test Binary Download

```bash
# Clean environment
rm -rf bin/ target/

# Test installer downloads binaries
./scripts/install.sh
```

### Step 4: Submit to AUR (Optional but Recommended)

Follow instructions in `packaging/aur/README.md`:

```bash
# Binary package (recommended for users)
git clone ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/anna-assistant-bin.git
cd anna-assistant-bin
cp ../anna-assistant/packaging/aur/PKGBUILD-bin PKGBUILD
cp ../anna-assistant/packaging/aur/anna-assistant.install .
# Update checksums from GitHub release
makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO
git add PKGBUILD anna-assistant.install .SRCINFO
git commit -m "Initial import: anna-assistant-bin 0.11.0"
git push
```

## Installation Methods Summary

After release is complete, users will have 4 installation methods:

| Method | Time | Rust Required | Best For |
|--------|------|---------------|----------|
| **AUR Binary** (`yay -S anna-assistant-bin`) | 30s | No | Arch users (easiest) |
| **Smart Installer** (`./scripts/install.sh`) | 30s | No | All distros, quick setup |
| **AUR Source** (`yay -S anna-assistant`) | 3min | No* | Arch users, latest code |
| **Source Build** (`./scripts/install.sh --build`) | 3min | Yes | Developers, custom builds |

*AUR handles Rust as build dependency automatically

## Benefits of This Upgrade

### For Users
- âœ… **No Rust installation required** (for binary downloads)
- âœ… **Faster installation** (30 seconds vs 3 minutes)
- âœ… **Multiple installation options** (AUR, installer, manual)
- âœ… **Offline installation support** (manual binary placement)
- âœ… **Better error messages** with actionable solutions

### For Maintainers
- âœ… **Automated releases** (GitHub Actions)
- âœ… **Native Arch packaging** (AUR integration)
- âœ… **Consistent binaries** (built in CI, not locally)
- âœ… **Clear release process** (documented checklist)
- âœ… **Easier user support** (fewer "how do I install" questions)

### For Distribution
- âœ… **Lower barrier to entry** (no build tools needed)
- âœ… **Broader reach** (works on more systems)
- âœ… **Professional appearance** (like other system tools)
- âœ… **Scalable** (binary downloads vs everyone building)

docs/RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md               # Maintainer release guide
DISTRIBUTION-UPGRADE-SUMMARY.md         # This file
```

### Modified Files
```
scripts/install.sh                      # Completely rewritten with smart installer
```

## Testing

### Scenarios Tested

âœ… Installer help message (`--help`)
âœ… Architecture detection
âœ… Prerequisite checking (rust/cargo)
âœ… Error messages when downloads fail
âœ… Error messages when build tools missing

### Scenarios to Test After Release

- [ ] Binary download for x86_64
- [ ] Binary download for aarch64
- [ ] Offline installation via `./bin/`
- [ ] AUR installation (both packages)
- [ ] Upgrade from v0.10.x to v0.11.0

## Next Actions

### Immediate (For Your Installation)

```bash
# Install Rust
sudo pacman -S rust

# Run installer
./scripts/install.sh

# Verify
annactl doctor check
```

### Soon (For Distribution)

1. **Create first release:**
   ```bash
   git tag -a v0.11.0 -m "Release v0.11.0 - Binary distribution"
   git push origin v0.11.0
   ```

2. **Wait for GitHub Actions to complete** (~10 minutes)

3. **Test binary download:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/install.sh  # Should download binaries
   ```

4. **Submit to AUR** (optional but recommended)

### Future (Continuous Improvement)

- Monitor installation success rates
- Gather user feedback on installation experience
- Add more architectures if needed (armv7, etc.)
- Consider additional distribution methods (Flatpak, AppImage, etc.)

## Questions?

- **Where are the binaries built?** GitHub Actions (Ubuntu runners)
- **How often are releases created?** On-demand (when you push a tag)
- **Can users still build from source?** Yes! Use `--build` flag
- **What if GitHub is down?** Users can build from source or use offline binaries
- **How do updates work?** Re-run installer or `yay -Syu` (AUR)

---

**Status:** Ready for first release! ðŸš€

All infrastructure is in place. Just need to create the v0.11.0 tag to trigger the first automated build.
