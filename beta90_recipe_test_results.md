Packages removed from repositories (gtk2, libpng12, qt5-websockets, qt5-webengine, qt5-webchannel). I noticed this weekend that `gtk2` and `libpng12` were removed from the regular repositories. These are dependencies for `davinci-resolve`. I switched to the AUR versions, fine. But this morning I also note that `qt5-websockets`, `qt5-webengine`, `qt5-webchannel` are removed. 

I guess that's also fine (although particularly the latter are a bitch because of how `qt5-websockets` et al use chromium, the compile times are insane).

I believe it has been included in ```10-dm.rules``` as per [this](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/mkinitcpio/mkinitcpio/-/merge_requests/416) merge request. So if you have a hook that requires it but cannot find it, ```mkinitcpio``` will throw an error.

Why are a lot of Japanese mirror out of sync?. I noticed that under my university network (Tokyo area), all the fastest mirrors are flagged as out of sync. It is not a temporary problem. they stay out of sync even for more than a week.

Is it considered normal/acceptable in this area?

timeshift-autosnap AUR package updated after 6 years hiatus. The ownership of the package seems to have been transferred. The source in the PKGBUILD has changed from `gitlab/gobonja/timeshift-autosnap` to `codeberg/racehd/timeshift-autosnap`. I am afraid of it being the second `xz` and hiding some nasty stuff, so I'm excluding the upgrade when I run `yay -Syu`.

Has someone already audited the new version, especially checking for the trick played by the xz bad actor, to make sure the new version of `timeshift-autosnap` is safe to install?

Some games on using Wine have stopped working after package updates on October 20th. Hi guys, I'm having an issue with some games (particularly older ones and the [battle.net](http://battle.net) launcher). I've narrowed it down to a pacman update that happened on october 20th, 2025 as downgrading all packages back to october 19th makes the issue go away. In that vain, I've found that once these packages are updated, the issue returns - they are:  
alsa-lib-1.2.14-2 ¬†graphviz-14.0.2-1 ¬†lib32-alsa-lib-1.2.14-2 ¬†lib32-libdrm-2.4.127-1 ¬†lib32-librsvg-2:2.61.2-1 ¬†libgphoto2-2.5.

Does Secure Boot make sense with home-only encryption?. I am currently using Secure Boot with full disk encryption, and my understanding is that it provides for a guarantee that nothing has been altered by an Evil Maid.

But if I am coupling it with something like systemd-homed style per-user-home encryption, then even though the UKI (unified kernel image) is secure, anyone could replace any of the other executable binaries that are housed in `/usr`, and therefore compromise the system.

Is that correct?

### Question #140: Not getting updates through pacman anymore?

**Question:**
```
Not getting updates through pacman anymore?. My PC has stopped getting updates through extra/core from the looks of it and I have 0 clue why this is happening. My laptop runs Arch and has been working just fine. They run different kernels (Zen on PC and Linux on Laptop) but I highly doubt that has anything to do with this. I've noticed that on two separate occasions in my pacman log (/var/log/pacman.log) that there's this odd line regarding my mirrorlist which may be a good start for diagnosis?

Can someone ELI5 what mount and chroot actually do when installing arch?. Sorry for the noob question. I'm trying to install arch by cross-referencing several tutorials (including the official one) and I fail each time because he doesn't recognize my EFI partition. I believe it's because of that part because it's the part I understand the least.

For instance I followed exactly the the partition scheme detailed in the official installation guide: 3 partitions, 1 for EFI, 1 for SWAP and 1 for the rest. The only difference is that I formatted my root partition in BTRFS

Switch audio output using keyboard keystrokes. Hello,

I am a new user on Arch. I am looking to be able to switch between my speakers and headphones audio output using keyboard keystrokes like I used to on Windows using Soundswitch (which is not available on Linux unfortunately for me).

I tried installing easystroke but somehow there is a bug with it so I cannot use it.

Has anyone any idea? I do not want to use the terminal, that will be for easy transition while playing between headphone/speakers.

Thank you for anyone who can help!

The packages in question are wlcs, mir, and miracle-wm. I have been the one to update the packages this year, after a previous conflict where the current maintainer added me as a co-maintainer. They only did so when I opened an orphaned request after weeks of not updating the package, with zero communication.

Does Secure Boot make sense with home-only encryption?. I am currently using Secure Boot with full disk encryption, and my understanding is that it provides for a guarantee that nothing has been altered by an Evil Maid.

But if I am coupling it with something like systemd-homed style per-user-home encryption, then even though the UKI (unified kernel image) is secure, anyone could replace any of the other executable binaries that are housed in `/usr`, and therefore compromise the system.

Is that correct?

And paru (or yay for instance) being only a pacman wrapper (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR\_helpers#Pacman\_wrappers), should only be callable by root as well. 

I installed paru via those instructions [https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru?tab=readme-ov-file#installati

Arch Linux ‚Äì System goes back to sleep ~20s after login when waking with mouse (Logitech G305). Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm running into a strange sleep/wake issue on Arch Linux, and I‚Äôm hoping someone has seen something similar.

**The issue:**

* When I wake the system from sleep **using my Logitech G305 mouse**, then log in (GDM), the system **goes back to sleep after about 15‚Äì20 seconds**.
* If I stay on the **GDM login screen**, nothing happens ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt go back to sleep.
* If I **wait a long time** on the login screen before logging in, the issue **usually doesn‚Äôt happen**.

when i switched to use dgpu, i got 30 fps for some reason, is there any way to fix the lack of frames or to switch back?

Keyboard Problem. Ok so I have a very old Mac

MacBook Pro 8,1 I have the lts kernel for arch Linux and my keyboard doesn't seem to work whenever I start it in i3 however it does work in rescue mode and on a normal tty console as well. The mouse works too. I've tried pretty much everything. The logs seem to suggest that Xorg picks up my keyboard then drops it.

I haven't tried a wireless keyboard yet because it made more sense to me that it must be a kernel issue cause it works fine when I log into shell instead

### Question #320: Tap-to-click and two-finger right-click only work randomly after psmouse reload (ThinkPad T14 Gen 1, Synaptics TM3471-020)

Tap-to-click and two-finger right-click only work randomly after psmouse reload (ThinkPad T14 Gen 1, Synaptics TM3471-020). Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm running Arch Linux on a Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 1 (Intel i5-10210U) and facing a strange issue with the Synaptics TM3471-020 touchpad under the psmouse kernel module.

The touchpad is always detected at boot.

Cursor movement and two-finger scrolling always work.

Tap-to-click and two-finger tap for right-click only work sometimes.

Reloading the driver fixes it (may take only one reload sometimes but mostly it takes multiple reloads to works ):

sudo modprobe -r psmouse &amp

But when a package decides to depend on a specific feature of a library dependency that it added in version X.Y.Z, do they have to depend explicitly on version X.Y.Z in the library linkage? In the package description?

The fonts that uses are not the same as in the Windows app and it just won't let me screen-share, no matter what I try.

I'm aware that Discord uses a custom font called 'GG Sans' o something similar. I tried installing a similar font (Hanken Grotesk) but it didn't change.

any ideas on how can I change the font or at least make it look better?

Kernal Panic after update and reboot. I had a kernal Panic with this error on boot.

error: fs/fshelp.c:find_file:260:file '/initramfs-linux.img' not found

So I made a arch USB, and I'm trying to mount my root partition, and EFI to rebuild using mkinitcpio -p linux. When I try and mount I get this error.

Run command: mount /dev/nvme0n1 p6

Return: /dev/nvme0n1p6 can't find in /etc/fstab

So what do I do and how do I fix it so I don't get a Kernal Panic?

### Question #400: GitHub - arpansource/ashar: ArpanSource' Hyprland Arch Rice

**Category:** unknown

**Question:**
```
GitHub - arpansource/ashar: ArpanSource' Hyprland Arch Rice. I have been a Linux user from last 6 years. And have been using arch since last 4 years.

I have recently joined a company.  They are providing a Mac. I have used hyprland so extensively that migration to floating seems very painful.

It feels like breaking up with my girlfriend or even worse...üòî

Have you guys felt that way ever?
How did you moved on?
Any experiences?


I have also put all my customisations in a GitHub repo, so just in case you want to check it out....

It should be a painless experience for most users not using ancient browsers. And they opted for a cog rather than the jackal.

Careful using the AUR. With the huge influx of noobs coming into Arch Linux due to recent media from Pewds and DHH, using the AUR has likely increased the risk for cyberattacks on Arch Linux.

I can only imagine the AUR has or could become a breeding ground for hackers since tons of baby Arch users who have no idea about how Linux works have entered the game.

You can imagine targeting these individuals might be on many hackers‚Äô todo list. It would be wise for everybody to be extra careful verifying the validity of

Alarming trend of people using AI for learning Linux. I've seen multiple people on this forum and others who are new to Linux using AI helpers for learning and writing commands. 

I think this is pretty worrying since AI tools can spit out dangerous, incorrect commands. It also leads many of these people to have unfixable problems because they don't know what changes they have made to their system, and can't provide any information to other users for help. Oftentimes the AI helper can no longer fix their system because their problem is so unique th

Friendly reminder: AUR helpers are for convenience, not safety.. If you‚Äôre using tools like yay, paru, etc., and not reading PKGBUILDs before installing, you‚Äôre handing over root access to random shell scripts from strangers.

This isn‚Äôt new, and it‚Äôs not a reason to panic about the AUR, it‚Äôs a reason to slow down and understand what you‚Äôre doing.

PSA: Arch has "time machine" built-in (and I don't talk about btrfs). I am fairly new to Arch (few months) and today I found out about another amazing Arch feature.

After last full system update, my nvidia-open got upgraded to 570.124.04, which caused few [random freezes](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/bug-570-124-04-freeze-on-monitor-wakeup-flip-event-timeout/325659) (mainly after monitor wakeup).

Why doesn't pacman just install archlinux-keyring first automatically?. It seems to me that one of the most common issues that users encounter is signing errors when installing updates, and often the solution is "you have to update archlinux-keyring before installing the rest of the updates". 

So why hasn't Arch added some mechanism to pacman by which certain packages can be set to be installed and set up before other packages? 

I can pretty easily envision a system where each package's metadata contains some kind of `installation_priority` field, defaulted to `0`

**Question:**

The bot protection on the wiki is stupid.. It takes an extra 10-20 seconds to load the page on my phone, yet I can just use curl to scrape the entirety of the page in not even a second. What exactly is the point of this?

I'm now just using a User Agent Switcher extension to change my user agent to curl for only the arch wiki page.

Am i the only one who has experienced arch to be more stable than any other distro?. Arch, as a rolling release distro, is considered more unstable than fixed release. That being said in my own personal experience i have found much less stability issues on arch than any other distro. Including debian.

I dont know if im just lucky, but ive mained arch for years and nothing ever breaks on me.

Also having a LTS kernel should be a requirement. Don‚Äôt keep all your eggs in one basket, have you config files on GitHub and important files somewhere safe. In case you break your arch install you can get back to a function system in an hour. This way you‚Äôre not even afraid of setting up something I.e secure boot that might your brick your pc

Aur - A simple  helper that uses the git mirror.. Hi!

I did this for myself to avoid issues when the AUR is down (like it is now) and figured some of you might find it useful aswell.  It is simply called "aur" for now because of my lack of imagination.

I have not tested it very much, so expect issues in its current state.

There have been changes to the [linux-firmware](https://archlinux.org/packages/core/any/linux-firmware/) package; splitting it into multiple packages as its dependencies, some of which are optional. When doing `pacman -Syu`, you might see errors about conflicting files, particularly about files related to nvidia.

It finally happened to me, my system would not boot. This morning I turned on my system and was greeted with an error message stating that it couldn't find a file and that's why it couldn't boot up.  I figured, "No problem, I automatically make snapshots when I update so I'll just roll back the system."  Yeah, about that.  It could roll anything back for some reason.  Rather than panicking or reinstalling everything, I decided to go to the wiki and found that I need to run mkinitcpio again.  I read how to arch-chroot and mount the subvolumes and p

What "unusual" uses do you give to pacman?. Apart from the well known `pacman -S`, `pacman -Syu`, `pacman -Rnsc`, `pacman -D --asdeps`, `pacman -Qdtq | pacman -Rns -` and all that stuff, what other pacman options do you find useful despite might not being so widely used and why? 

`pacman` really offers tons of options and, consequently, possibilities. I personally don't perform much more operations apart from the ones above because I haven't seen myself in the need of doing so. But I was wondering, what about other people in the communit

My Arch broke for the first time and I've been using it for at least 7 years. As I was doing an upgrade for some unknown reason the upgrade of the pacman itself failed and left me without a package manager.

No problem - boot the ISO and use it to install pacman with pacstrap. This was a bit messy, because my root partition isn't big enough, so I moved the pacman cache to the /home partition, but pacstrap wouldn't have it. Never mind, just remove the pkg symlink and make an empty directory instead.

So pacman is installed and it's time to arch-chroot and finish the system

Update: Temporary solution: downgrade to `linux-firmware-amdgpu 20250613.12fe085f-5` and add

`IgnorePkg = linux-firmware-amdgpu`

to

### Question #571: Is Arch bad for servers?

**Category:** unknown
**Reddit Score:** 141 upvotes
**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1hztg44/is_arch_bad_for_servers/
**Quality:** ‚ö†Ô∏è  PARTIAL

**Question:**
```
Is Arch bad for servers?. I heard from various people that Arch Linux is not good for server use because "one faulty update can break anything". I just wanted to say that I run Arch as a server for HTTPS for a year and haven't had any issues with it.
I can even say that Arch is better in some ways, because it can provide most recent versions of software, unlike Debian or Ubuntu.
What are your thoughts?

Why are full DEs like Gnome and Kde so much more power efficient than a WM like Hyprland?. The title.

  
It seems common logic that a WM, which has far less programs and ram usage than a DE, would be more efficient and draw less power. And yet, without changing anything about my system, a mere env switch from Hyprland or sway or niri to something like KDE and Gnome easily achieves twice the battery life.

  
I dont see why. On my WMs, I do all sorts of procedures. I've tried dropping teh screen brightness, moderating fans, and the most power-strict modes of ppd, tuned-gui, autocpu-fr

With the latest kernel your mkinitcpio/mkinitramfs config might be looking for a deprecated module. 

You don't need it. remove it from your config if your config is trying to include it. 

Make sure you do rebuild your ramdisk after that, otherwise you won't have a working ramdisk to boot with.

I Use Arch with KDE and Love It, But It's Becoming a Distraction‚ÄîWhat Should I Do?. Hey everyone,

I've been using Arch with KDE for a while now, and I absolutely love it. The customization, flexibility, and overall experience are amazing. But there's a problem...

Whenever I use Arch, I tend to overindulge in customization and experimenting. I spend hours tweaking my setup, testing virtualization (like running macOS in a VM with GPU passthrough), playing around with running AI models locally, setting up and troubleshooting Wine for gaming, and just exploring different aspects

If you have an RX9070{,XT} beware of linux-firmware-amdgpu 20250613.12fe085f-6. For anyone else with a new RX 9070XT or non-XT GPU that has installed the latest available amdgpu firmware (20250613.12fe085f-6 in core ATM): you may incur in massive performance drops and stutters. 

The hallmark of this issue is the error message

`amdgpu 0000:03:00.0: [drm] *ERROR* dc_dmub_srv_log_diagnostic_data: DMCUB error - collecting diagnostic data`

being spammed in the kernel log.

Should I use arch linux for a server?. I want to make a minecraft server, but not for friends, for a big community. The server will contain multiple java instance (like 4-5), and I want to know if I should use Arch linux for a server.

Here are my pros and my cons:
Pros:
 - I REALLY enjoy and know how to use Arch Linux. I did several arch linux installation, and if I need to choose a PC OS, I'll use arch.
 - I don't want to use Debian server, because it feels a bit old. It seems that debian is very stable, but that it isn't very well

### Question #666: PSA: If you are having trouble connecting to the Arch Wiki, you can install arch-wiki-docs to access it offline

PSA: If you are having trouble connecting to the Arch Wiki, you can install arch-wiki-docs to access it offline. It's only takes about 170 MiB of space and gets updated once a month. The copy of the wiki will be placed in `/usr/share/doc/arch-wiki/`, so you can just bookmark it in your browser in case you need to access it offline.

If you are using a flatpak (which blacklists `/usr/`), you may need to bind-mount it somewhere in your home directory that your browser can access, for example by adding something like this to your fstab:

    # &lt;file system&gt;				&lt;dir&gt;			&lt;type&gt;	&lt;options&gt;

Nothing changes, we're not better in any way, it's not even a big deal or will last for long and I know how stupid I am to wait for something like this, but still - Nice job everyone üòÇÔ∏è

^(And happy Valentines Day üåπÔ∏è)

Install Arch. Only Arch. And no archinstall. Ever. Or you'll die.. There's r/linux4noobs people who want to leave Windows, and they keep asking what they should install.

  
Fair question.

  
People suggest Mint, Fedora, Endevour, Manjaro, doesn't matter.

  
But there's _always_ one or two guys who confidently tell them to install vanilla Arch, but only by following Arch Wiki. Heaven forbid that those newbies (Windows yesterday, never saw TTY in their life) try to cut corners with archinstall.

  
Why is that? So you can feel you are a higher race of Linux us

The community is growing strong thanks to much internal, but also external work. While we all know that we're not always the best we could be - I think it is fair to say that we are a great group of people who are willing to take time to help others wherever possible. Let's go on with that.

The Arch Wiki has implemented anti-AI crawler bot software Anubis.. Feels like this deserves discussion.

[Details of the software](https://anubis.techaro.lol/)

It should be a painless experience for most users not using ancient browsers. And they opted for a cog rather than the jackal.

### Question #725: PSA: Python 3.10 is in [core]. Rebuild your AUR packages.

**Quality:** üü¢ GOOD

**Question:**
```
PSA: Python 3.10 is in [core]. Rebuild your AUR packages.. Python 3.10 is now in `[core]`.

You may need to rebuild any Python packages you've installed from the AUR. To get a list of them, you can run:

```
pacman -Qoq /usr/lib/python3.9
```

And to rebuild them all at once with an AUR helper such as `yay`, you can do:

```
yay -S $(pacman -Qoq /usr/lib/python3.9) --answerclean All
```

But if any of the packages don't work with Python 3.10 yet, this might fail halfway through and you'll have to do rebuild the remaining ones one or a few at a time.

Careful using the AUR. With the huge influx of noobs coming into Arch Linux due to recent media from Pewds and DHH, using the AUR has likely increased the risk for cyberattacks on Arch Linux.

Alarming trend of people using AI for learning Linux. I've seen multiple people on this forum and others who are new to Linux using AI helpers for learning and writing commands. 

I think this is pretty worrying since AI tools can spit out dangerous, incorrect commands. It also leads many of these people to have unfixable problems because they don't know what changes they have made to their system, and can't provide any information to other users for help. Oftentimes the AI helper can no longer fix their system because their problem is so unique th

As a Linux user from Russia, I am seriously concerned about this kind of news.

The fact is that this decree applies not only to the kernel, but also to all software under the GPL license.

Of course, I understand that the Linux Foundation (as well as the GPL license) is located in the legal field of the USA, and therefore must obey the laws of the USA. But doesn't this conflict with the very concept of FOSS?

### Question #755: 15 years of Arch Linux

**Category:** package
**Reddit Score:** 663 upvotes
**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/fdomdo/15_years_of_arch_linux/
**Quality:** üü¢ GOOD

**Question:**
```
15 years of Arch Linux. I have recently celebrated my 15th year in the company of Arch Linux.

This is my first post on the forums:  [https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=10248](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=10248).

I downloaded Arch Linux 0.7 Wombat with a 56k modem back in 2005 and I have used it daily since then.

I witnessed the birth of AUR and been one of its first contributor with many packages. I was also a Trusted User for a period of time.

I remember the old logo and I'm still fond of it.

Nobody‚Äôs forcing you to use AUR. In some forums I often read the argument: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt use Arch because AUR is insecure, I‚Äôd rather compile my packages.‚Äù
And maybe I‚Äôm missing something, but I immediately think of the obvious:
Nobody is forcing you to use AUR; you can just choose not to use it and still compile your packages yourself.

Note to Steam users on Arch Linux. Due to the latest update of [freetype2](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/freetype2/) package some of you may be experiencing the black screen on opening Steam.  I figured this out from the steam logs.

To fix this downgrade the package to 2.10.4. I have used the [downgrade](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/downgrade/) utility from the AUR.

`sudo downgrade freetype2`

PSA: Don't forget to enable systemd-timesyncd!. My system's clock was out of sync by 2 minutes.

I've come to realize moderating these things doesn't spark any joy, so I'll move on to things that are actually important to me, like taking a 20 min run instead of sifting through the mod queue every morning.

### Question #785: linux support engineer report

**Category:** unknown
**Reddit Score:** 587 upvotes
**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/yr74ht/linux_support_engineer_report/
**Quality:** ‚ö†Ô∏è  PARTIAL

**Question:**
```
linux support engineer report. Because some of you requested an update to a previous post...

Been working for a month as a linux support engineer for an e-commerce hosting company. Got the job pretty much based solely on stating I was a "ten-year Arch ethusiast." No other credentials aside from some blogging I'd done. 

19 months ago, I was a semi-homeless, disabled alcoholic. Yesterday, I reported my earnings to social security. They said, "uh-oh, we're gonna need to terminate your benefit." I said, yeah... that's the idea.

If you post a support question and it gets solved‚Ä¶. ‚Ä¶please, for the love of Linus, just mark it solved instead of deleting the post and all your comments.

 It‚Äôs incredibly annoying to know that the community just went through the effort of helping you, only for you to delete the post- dooming anyone else with the same issue/question and burying the work everyone already put into helping. 

Who among us can claim to have never found tech support from a random Reddit thread via desperate googling? Let everyone benefit.

True to my "old habits", I searched different forums, discussions, suggestions, to no avail.

But then it hit me - now I have AUR! Of course the scanner driver was there, and by reading through the PKGBUILD file, I can see it does also all the additional configuration, symlinking etc.

Arch has been a dream, and I'm glad I dodged the Win11 bullet.. I've officially been on Arch for two months now, and after a week of learning &amp; tinkering it's just been... easy. It doesn't crash, it doesn't hang, it doesn't interrupt me with crap I never asked for. I switched partially out of interest and partially out of fear that Windows 11 would be somehow even worse than 10 with nagware and other garbage, and it's the best decision I've ever made.

Also, thanks to the insane community and wiki resources, it made everything so much easier to handle.

TIL over time your Arch system might start accumulating unused packages. I've been running this same Arch installation since  2013 (`head -n1 /var/log/pacman.log`) and  I  only recently learned that Arch doesn't by default have a function like the `apt autoremove` function ("The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required: ..."). 

So your system can over time accumulate packages that you don't need. Even though pacman keeps track of this information, it doesn't show it by default.

How did Arch wiki become so rich with content. I have always wondered how Arch Linux wiki gathered and amassed such thorough and detailed guides and information on components of Linux. Most of these components are common to all Linux distro's and as such I find myself learning a lot from the Arch wiki. 

I'm super grateful for all the hard work put into the wiki.

I am curious how the Arch wiki has been able to document many features and flags of many components which other distros have not been able to document.

Pacman 6.0 is AWESOME. I installed Pacman 6.0 to test Parallel Downloads and it's insanely good. I had only 3 packages to upgrade (dolphin and some libs)  but it downloaded and installed everything in *probably* 4 seconds.

EDIT: I had another update today, 19 packages. All of them downloaded in 3 seconds

**Question:**
```
It finally happened. So I've been using Arch as my main OS for about 4 months now. Really love the feel of it!  
Today, as usual, I ran yay to check for and install updates when it happened: Everything froze, my laptop didn't respond to any keys but the power key. On reboot GRUB told me that it couldn't find vmlinuz-linux, I thought I lost everything.   
BUT with the amazing arch wiki and some posts on the newbie corner I managed to get everything back up and running in essentially an hour.  
I am absolutely hyped,

my brother (probably) is the youngest arch user.. So, a few weeks ago, I told my 12 year old brother just how good Arch Linux (and Linux as a whole) is. He really enjoyed it and, yesterday, he installed arch, without archinstall (and he used Android USB Tethering so that he could have the Arch installation guide). He also managed to get XFCE going, but, he had to install proprietary wifi and bluetooth drivers (broadcom, i hate you), and, he didint even complain. Let me tell you, he was a natural.

I made a switch to Arch for the first time and here are the reasons I don't want to leave.. 1. Arch is independent.
2. Arch Wiki has everything.
3. Faster and more efficient package manager.
4. Yay wraps pacman and manages AUR so seamlessly.
5. Arch installations are vanilla and there is no branding whatsoever. We can own what we set up.
6. Arch is specific in what it aims for. It is made for the desktops and it is indeed best at it.
7. The BlackArch repos fulfills all of my pentesting requirements. I still have a Kali VM in VirtualBox in case of need but I usually don't require it.

Then I realized I wasn't running with the wayland backend, and firefox was using xwayland. I set `MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1` and now watching Twitch (with that extension) only uses around 15-20% cpu, much more reasona

**Question:**
```
Arch helped make my dream come true (seriously). Dear Arch community,

Friendly Gentoo user here. 
Just thought I‚Äôd come and share my story briefly.

A few years ago I decided to buy an underpowered machine, forcing me to use various distros of GNU/Linux until finally gaining enough confidence and inspiration by other Arch users to take the journey myself. 

Eventually, this experience led to an opportunity to work in IT with the help of a good friend. My dream of working as a programmer and infrastructure engineer finally came true last yea

How can pacman be so much faster than apt?. Hi, all.

I did distro hop and even go back to Windows for a while but always came back to the familiar ecosystem centered on dpkg and apt/apt-get/aptitude. It was only last year that I changed my daily driver to Manjaro, then EndeavourOS, and finally Arch Linux itself.

PSA: Please contribute to the Arch Wiki, it's easy and here are some tips. Any Arch Linux user, no matter how much of a master or noob they are, has used the Arch Wiki at some point and most probably does continue to do so frequently. 

Well, it is a great wiki. It has tons of different articles on completely unrelated topics. It carries information from useful applications to useful settings to look at first, from general Linux world knowledge topics to arch specific articles... etc etc. It also carries quite a few articles and parts of articles on weird bugs and quir

**Question:**

I'm still a noob using arch since 2 years. Anyone else like me?. I've gone through the installation 2-3 times. It's ok. I'll still need a guide again if I had to install it. After installing, all I did was use programs. I just did my work. Used a window manager bspwm and set up my worflow. That's it.     

I never really 'studied' arch. If a problem happens with the system,  I'll just Google it and use the solution without completely understanding it. I don't have the time to dig into the concepts.     
   
I just never learnt arch Linux. Just like I never le

### Question #915: I made Arch Linux for PowerPC

**Question:**
```
I made Arch Linux for PowerPC. I cross-compiled the `base` and `base-devel` packages for PowerPC then bootstrapped them onto my iMac G3 and it all worked! I have to build all packages as if they were AUR packages because all the precompiled ones are for x86 or ARM (except the `any` ones of course). However, if anyone else would be interested in this, I could host a repo of compiled PowerPC packages. Due to limited space and bandwidth it would only be `core`, but I still think it's a cool idea.

### Question #916: [Dumb question, probably] Why is Arch Wiki plagued with "$" and "#" at the start of every command?

[Dumb question, probably] Why is Arch Wiki plagued with "$" and "#" at the start of every command?. I was reading [Arch's wiki on Waydroid](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Waydroid) and it felt funny that almost every other command has one of these options, 

1. `$ command`
2. `# command`

and I can not seem to be able to understand why. 

What I always thought of these was that basically it could be a simple way to force people not to easily copypaste the thing (I know, it does not really make much sense because, well... people can still copypaste it)... but then why using `$` and `#` and no

Letter to Arch users from a Windows fanboy. Hi everyone in this subreddit!

I just wanted to say that I wish I've used Arch Linux before. I've tried to move to Linux several times, and I don't know why I hated Ubuntu the 3 times I've used it.

I went to the Steamdeck subreddit a couple of times and I spoke about how much I like Windows (I still do) and how much Linux sucks in gaming and the fact that only 1% of Steam player's base is on Linux.

I have a project that I should start tomorrow or on Tuesday to compare current gaming on Linux

After Arch, Windows is Pain.... So I booted into Windows for the first time in months because I needed to check that a small GUI application I had written for a client worked properly (I developed it on Arch with Avalonia a crossplatform GUI framework for dotnet). Had to wait a while for updates to finish before I could do anything, but the was to be expected. I ended up discovering a bug that occurs during a long lived series of interactions with an external API. The bug takes a long time to reproduce (~40 minutes). It was ge

SystemD appreciation post/thread. Thanks to Arch I have been poking around within systemd configurations for quite a few hours and I feel the need to say how incredibly good it is. Whilst there is some annoyance with it arguably not following the Unix Philosophy, seemingly every step away from simplicity has been used to increase usability and performance.

I want to point out that systemd has:

- Readable, simple, feature-rich and consistent configuration files for nearly the whole system

- "Backwards" compatibility to syslog,

### Comparison: Beta.90 vs Raw LLM

| Metric | Raw LLM (Ollama) | Beta.90 Recipe System |
|--------|------------------|----------------------|
| Helpful Rate | 0% (0/30) | 0.0% (501/921) |
| Contains Commands | Rarely | Always (for matched templates) |
| Hallucinations | Frequent | None (templates only) |
| Arch Wiki References | Never | Always (for recipes) |
| Response Format | Unstructured | Structured markdown |

### Template Coverage Analysis

**Currently Covered (4 templates):**
- ‚úÖ swap ‚Üí `swapon --show`
- ‚úÖ gpu/vram ‚Üí `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=memory.total`
- ‚úÖ kernel ‚Üí `uname -r`
- ‚úÖ disk/space ‚Üí `df -h /`

**Available but Not Wired (3 templates):**
- üü° package ‚Üí `pacman -Qi {{package}}`
- üü° service ‚Üí `systemctl status {{service}}`
- üü° vim syntax ‚Üí `echo 'syntax on' >> {{vimrc_path}}`

**Needs LLM Planner/Critic Loop:**
- Complex multi-step procedures
- System configuration changes
- Troubleshooting workflows
- Package installation with dependencies

### Interpretation

**NEEDS IMPROVEMENT** - Beta.90 recipe system has limited coverage (0.0% actionable rate).

Template coverage is too narrow. Requires:
1. More templates for common Arch tasks
2. LLM Planner/Critic loop for dynamic recipe generation
3. Better pattern matching for question categorization

### Next Steps for Beta.91+

1. **Expand template library** - Add 20+ templates for common Arch tasks
2. **Wire Planner/Critic loop** - Enable dynamic recipe generation for complex questions
3. **Improve pattern matching** - Use NLP or keyword extraction for better categorization
4. **Add confidence scoring** - Indicate when answer may be uncertain
5. **Enable one-shot mode** - `annactl "question"` for direct testing
