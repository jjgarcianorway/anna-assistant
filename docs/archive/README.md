# Archive

This directory contains historical design documents and internal development notes.

These documents describe the evolution of Anna's architecture but are **not user-facing documentation**.

For current, user-facing documentation, see:
- `../PRODUCT_VISION.md` - What Anna is and why
- `../USER_GUIDE.md` - How to use Anna
- Root `README.md` - Quick start

**Note**: These archived documents may reference "phases", internal engines, and development stages that are not relevant to end users. They are kept for historical reference and for developers interested in Anna's evolution.
