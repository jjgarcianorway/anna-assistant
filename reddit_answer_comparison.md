AFAIA, the plan for Arch is to transition to their still-in-development central build service called `buildbtw` (financially backed by Valve). There's a milestone for "secondary architectures" set up on the buildbtw issue tracker.

I decided I need the (super important) Reddit karma this release!


Very quick update summary:

* fixes to download sandboxing, and finer-grained options for disabling parts of it
* expired keys should have updates fetched automatically (reliability depends on key infrastructure...) - this should remove the "package is corrupt" messages when keys need updated.
* parallelize stripping in makepkg, along with various improvements to debug packages

You should seriously look into auto updates and automatic fallback boot snapshots. This is asking for trouble. Arch can be reliable but it needs to be set up as such.
