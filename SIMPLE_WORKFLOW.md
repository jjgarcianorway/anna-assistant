# Simple Workflow - Just 2 Scripts

## For Developers (Local Testing)

```bash
./scripts/release.sh              # Builds & pushes to GitHub
sudo ./scripts/install.sh --local # Installs from local build
```

## For End Users

```bash
sudo ./scripts/install.sh   # Downloads latest from GitHub
```

That's it. Two scripts, zero confusion.
