ðŸŽ‰ What's New in v0.9.5-beta

CONVERSATIONAL INSTALLER
I now speak to you in plain English throughout installation.
No more technical jargon - just friendly explanations.

UNIFIED MESSAGING
All my output uses the same warm, helpful tone.
Whether it's the installer, annactl, or system logs.

SMART PRIVILEGE REQUESTS
When I need administrator rights, I explain why.
You'll always know what I'm doing and can choose to proceed.

REGIONAL FORMATTING
Dates and times match your locale preferences.
Norwegian? German? English? I speak your language.

USER CONFIGURATION
Create ~/.config/anna/config.yml to customize:
- Colors and emojis (on/off)
- Verbose output (on/off)
- Privilege confirmation (on/off)

Try 'annactl doctor check' to see the new style!
