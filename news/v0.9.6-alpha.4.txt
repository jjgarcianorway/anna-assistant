üö® CRITICAL FIX: NO SUDO REQUIRED

v0.9.6-alpha.4 fixes installer philosophy:

‚ùå WRONG (before):
  sudo ./scripts/install.sh

‚úÖ CORRECT (now):
  ./scripts/install.sh

Anna's Promise: "You don't need sudo. I'll ask politely when I need it."

What changed:
‚Ä¢ Run installer as regular user
‚Ä¢ Friendly privilege escalation
  - Explains why: "I need administrator rights to install system files."
  - Asks permission: "May I proceed? [Y/n]"
  - You can approve or decline
‚Ä¢ All docs updated (no more sudo)
‚Ä¢ Respects your session & environment

My apologies for the confusion in earlier versions.
This is how it should have been from the start.

Install the right way:
  ./scripts/install.sh
