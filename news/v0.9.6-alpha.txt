ðŸŽ‰ What's New in v0.9.6-alpha

DEEP SYSTEM PROFILING
I can now understand your system deeply - hardware, graphics,
audio, network, boot performance, and software stack.
No manual investigation needed.

SMART PLAYBOOKS
Ask me to improve things and I'll create a safe plan:
â€¢ Browser hardware acceleration
â€¢ Beautiful Hyprland setup
â€¢ Faster boot times
â€¢ Optimized power settings
â€¢ Smart shell aliases

Your input drives everything. I explain what I'll do,
show you the plan, and you decide.

PRIVACY & CONSENT
You control what I analyze. Usage metrics off by default.
All collection is transparent and reversible.

CONFIG GOVERNANCE
One command to change anything: annactl config set
Config files tell you to use me instead of manual edits.

THE "ASK" INTERFACE
Natural language requests route to smart actions:
"make my Hyprland beautiful"
"enable browser hardware acceleration"
"speed up my boot"

Try 'annactl profile show' to see what I've learned!
