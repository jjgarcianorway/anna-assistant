## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: `.claude/settings.local.json` Blocking Release

**Problem:**
```
✗ Working directory is not clean. Commit or stash changes first.
 M .claude/settings.local.json
```

**Solution:**
- Added `.claude/settings.local.json` to `.gitignore`
- Reverted uncommitted changes
- This file tracks local Claude Code permissions and shouldn't be committed

**Result:** ✅ Release script works now!
