# Latest Release Improvements - Dynamic Version Fetching

## What Changed

### 1. ✅ Installer Now Fetches Latest Release Automatically

**Problem:** Installer had hardcoded version, requiring manual updates on every release.

**Solution:** Installer now queries GitHub API to get the latest release dynamically.

**Before:**
```bash
VERSION="0.11.0"  # Had to update this manually
url="https://github.com/.../releases/download/v${VERSION}/..."
```

**After:**
```bash
# Fetches latest release from GitHub API
fetch_latest_release()  # Gets latest version tag
url="https://github.com/.../releases/download/${LATEST_VERSION}/..."
```

**Result:**
- ✅ No version hardcoding in installer
- ✅ Always downloads the latest release
- ✅ Works without manual updates after each release

---

### 2. ✅ Release Script Simplified

**Problem:** Release script was updating install.sh unnecessarily.

**Solution:** Removed install.sh from update process since it's now version-agnostic.

**Before:** Updated 4 files
- Cargo.toml
- scripts/install.sh ← No longer needed
- packaging/aur/PKGBUILD
- packaging/aur/PKGBUILD-bin

**After:** Updates 3 files
- Cargo.toml
- packaging/aur/PKGBUILD
- packaging/aur/PKGBUILD-bin

---

### 3. ✅ Better Semantic Versioning Explanation

**Added clear documentation** for the `-t` parameter:

```
-t patch    Bug fixes (0.11.1 -> 0.11.2)
-t minor    New features (0.11.1 -> 0.12.0)
-t major    Breaking changes (0.11.1 -> 1.0.0)
```

---

## Complete Workflow

### Creating a Release

```bash
# 1. Make your changes
git add -A
git commit -m "Your changes"

# 2. Create release (one command!)
./scripts/release.sh -t patch -m "Bug fixes and improvements"

# 3. Wait ~10 minutes for GitHub Actions to build binaries
```

### What Happens Automatically

1. **Release script:**
   - Detects current version: `0.11.1`
   - Bumps to new version: `0.11.2`
   - Updates Cargo.toml and PKGBUILDs
   - Creates git commit and tag `v0.11.2`
   - Pushes to GitHub

2. **GitHub Actions:**
   - Triggered by new tag
   - Builds binaries for x86_64 and aarch64
   - Creates GitHub release
   - Uploads binaries and checksums

3. **Installer (users running it):**
   - Fetches latest release info from GitHub API
   - Sees `v0.11.2` is available
   - Downloads `anna-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` from v0.11.2 release
   - Installs automatically

**No manual intervention needed!** 🎉

## Understanding Semantic Versioning

### What is `-t patch`?

Semantic versioning uses three numbers: **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**

Example: `0.11.1`
- `0` = Major version (breaking changes)
- `11` = Minor version (new features)
- `1` = Patch version (bug fixes)

### When to Use Each Type

#### `-t patch` - Bug Fixes & Small Changes
**Use for:**
- Bug fixes
- Documentation updates
- Performance improvements
- Security patches
- Small improvements

**Example:** `0.11.1 -> 0.11.2`

```bash
./scripts/release.sh -t patch -m "Fix installation bug on fresh systems"
```

#### `-t minor` - New Features
**Use for:**
- New features
- Enhancements to existing features
- Non-breaking changes
- New capabilities

**Example:** `0.11.2 -> 0.12.0`

```bash
./scripts/release.sh -t minor -m "Add system monitoring dashboard"
```

#### `-t major` - Breaking Changes
**Use for:**
- Breaking API changes
- Major architecture changes
- Incompatible updates
- Removing deprecated features

**Example:** `0.12.0 -> 1.0.0`

```bash
./scripts/release.sh -t major -m "Stable 1.0 release with new config format"
```

### Quick Decision Guide

```
Did something break for users?          → major
Added new features (everything works)?  → minor
Fixed bugs (no new features)?           → patch
Not sure?                               → patch (safest)
```

---

## Examples

### Example 1: You Fixed a Bug

```bash
# Bug fix = patch release
./scripts/release.sh -t patch -m "Fix daemon not starting on reboot"

# Result: 0.11.1 -> 0.11.2
```

### Example 2: You Added a New Command

```bash
# New feature = minor release
./scripts/release.sh -t minor -m "Add 'annactl snapshot' command for backups"

# Result: 0.11.2 -> 0.12.0
```

### Example 3: You Changed the Config Format

```bash
# Breaking change = major release
./scripts/release.sh -t major -m "New config format (old configs need migration)"

# Result: 0.12.0 -> 1.0.0
```

### Example 4: Multiple Changes

If you have multiple types of changes, use the **highest severity**:
- Bug fixes + new feature = `-t minor`
- Bug fixes + breaking change = `-t major`
- New features + breaking change = `-t major`

## Why This Matters

### For Users
**Before:**
- Installer might download old version
- Manual intervention needed

**After:**
- Always gets the latest version
- Zero configuration

### For You (Maintainer)
**Before:**
```bash
# Manual version updates in multiple files
vim Cargo.toml          # Update version
vim scripts/install.sh  # Update version
vim packaging/aur/...   # Update version
git add ...
git commit ...
git tag ...
git push ...
git push --tags
```

**After:**
```bash
# One command!
./scripts/release.sh -t patch -m "Your message"
```

**Time saved:** 5 minutes per release → 10 seconds

---

## Testing

### Test the Installer (After Release)

```bash
# Clean environment
rm -rf bin/ target/

# Test installer fetches latest
./scripts/install.sh
```

**You should see:**
```
→ Fetching latest release information...
✓ Latest release: v0.11.2
→ Downloading pre-compiled binaries for x86_64...
  Downloading: anna-linux-x86_64.tar.gz (v0.11.2)
```

### Test Release Script (Dry Run)

```bash
# Preview without making changes
./scripts/release.sh -t patch -m "Test" --dry-run
```

---

## Files Changed

### Modified Files
- `scripts/install.sh` - Now fetches latest release dynamically
- `scripts/release.sh` - Removed install.sh update, added semantic versioning docs

### What Doesn't Need Updates Anymore
- ✅ `scripts/install.sh` - Auto-fetches latest version

### What Still Gets Updated
- ✅ `Cargo.toml` - Source of truth for version
- ✅ `packaging/aur/PKGBUILD*` - AUR package versions

---

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Create a patch release (bug fixes)
./scripts/release.sh -t patch -m "Fix XYZ bug"

# Create a minor release (new features)
./scripts/release.sh -t minor -m "Add ABC feature"

# Create a major release (breaking changes)
./scripts/release.sh -t major -m "Version 1.0 with breaking changes"

# Preview changes without committing
./scripts/release.sh -t patch -m "Test" --dry-run

# Show detailed help
./scripts/release.sh --help

# Install (users)
./scripts/install.sh  # Always gets latest release!
```

## FAQ

### Q: Do I still need to manually create GitHub releases?
**A:** No! The release script creates the tag, and GitHub Actions automatically builds binaries and creates the release.

### Q: What if I make a mistake with the version?
**A:** You can delete the tag locally and remotely:
```bash
git tag -d v0.11.2
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.11.2
```
Then run the release script again.

### Q: Can I use a custom version number?
**A:** Yes! Use `-v` instead of `-t`:
```bash
./scripts/release.sh -v 0.11.2-beta -m "Beta release"
```

### Q: What if GitHub is down?
**A:** Users can still build from source:
```bash
./scripts/install.sh --build
```

### Q: Does the installer require internet?
**A:** Only for downloading binaries. Users can place binaries in `./bin/` for offline installation.
