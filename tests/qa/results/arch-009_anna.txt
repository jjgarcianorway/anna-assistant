[36mℹ[39m [2mThis will allow you to manually downgrade a package. Note that Arch Linux does not officially support downgrading packages, and it's generally recommended to avoid doing so unless absolutely necessary.[0m

[36mℹ[39m [2mExplanation: The first command uses pamac (the official package manager for Manjaro/Arch) with the `--downgrade` option to rebuild the specified package from an older version in the cache. The second command uses pacman directly to install a specific version of the package from the cache, but be cautious as this can overwrite installed packages and may lead to dependency issues.[0m
[36mℹ[39m [2m[0m
[36mℹ[39m [2mPlease replace `<package-name>` with the actual name of the package you want to downgrade. Also, make sure you have the necessary space in your `/var/cache/pacman/pkg` directory for these operations.[0m
