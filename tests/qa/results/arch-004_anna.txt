[36mℹ[39m [2mExplanation: When editing `/etc/default/grub`, it's essential to regenerate the GRUB configuration to apply changes. `update-grub` is the command that does just this, updating the grub.cfg file with your new settings. The `--no-cache-test` option is typically used when you've made significant changes to ensure the regeneration process doesn't get stuck in an infinite loop.[0m
