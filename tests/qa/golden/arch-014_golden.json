    "steps": [
      "View all logs for service: journalctl -u <service-name>",
      "View logs from current boot only: journalctl -u <service-name> -b",
      "View last 50 lines: journalctl -u <service-name> -n 50",
      "Follow logs in real-time: journalctl -u <service-name> -f",
      "Show logs since specific time: journalctl -u <service-name> --since '1 hour ago'",
      "Show only errors: journalctl -u <service-name> -p err",
      "Show with timestamps: journalctl -u <service-name> -o short-iso"

    "warnings": [
      "Journal can be large - use filters (boot, time, priority) to narrow results",
      "Use -b to see only current boot (helpful after reboot)",
