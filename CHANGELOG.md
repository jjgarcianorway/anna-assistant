  - Docker usage → docker-compose, lazydocker
  - Vim usage → neovim upgrade suggestion

- **CLI Tool Improvements** (based on command history analysis)
  - `ls` usage → eza (colors, icons, git integration)
  - `cat` usage → bat (syntax highlighting)
  - `grep` usage → ripgrep (10x faster)
  - `find` usage → fd (modern, intuitive)
  - `du` usage → dust (visual disk usage)
  - `top/htop` usage → btop (beautiful system monitor)

- **Shell Enhancements**
  - fzf (fuzzy finder)

- `common_file_types` - Programming languages detected
- `desktop_environment` - Detected DE
- `display_server` - X11 or Wayland
- `shell` - User's shell
- `has_wifi`, `has_ethernet` - Network capabilities
