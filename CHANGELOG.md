## [1.0.0-beta.7] - 2025-11-04

### 🎉 Anna Speaks Human Now!

We've completely rewritten every message Anna shows you. No more technical jargon!

### What Changed
- **All advice is now in plain English** - Instead of "AMD CPU detected without microcode updates," Anna now says "Your AMD processor needs microcode updates to protect against security vulnerabilities like Spectre and Meltdown. Think of it like a security patch for your CPU itself."
- **Friendly messages everywhere** - "Taking a look at your system..." instead of "Analyzing system..."
- **Your system looks great!** - When everything is fine, Anna celebrates with you
- **Better counting** - "Found 1 thing that could make your system better!" reads naturally
- **Enthusiastic release notes** - This changelog is now exciting to read!

### Why This Matters
Anna is for everyone, not just Linux experts. Whether you're brand new to Arch or you've been using it for years, Anna talks to you like a helpful friend, not a robot. Every message explains *why* something matters and what it actually does.

### Technical Details (for the curious)
- Rewrote all `Advice` messages in `recommender.rs` with conversational explanations
- Updated CLI output to be more welcoming
- Made sure singular/plural grammar is always correct
- Added analogies to help explain technical concepts

### What's New
- **Your SSD will thank you** - Anna now checks if your solid-state drive has TRIM enabled. This keeps it fast and healthy for years to come.
- **Save hundreds of gigabytes** - If you're using Btrfs, Anna will suggest turning on compression. You'll get 20-30% of your disk space back without slowing things down.
- **Faster package downloads** - Anna can set up parallel downloads in pacman, making updates 5x faster. Why wait around?
- **Prettier terminal output** - Enable colorful pacman output so you can actually see what's happening during updates.
- **Health monitoring** - Anna keeps an eye on your system services and lets you know if anything failed. No more silent problems.
