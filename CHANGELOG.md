**NEW:** Safely rollback workflow bundles with full tracking and reverse dependency order removal!

### ✨ Added

**🔄 Bundle Rollback Feature**
- New `annactl rollback --bundle "Bundle Name"` command
- Full installation history tracking stored in `/var/lib/anna/bundle_history.json`
- Tracks what was installed, when, and by whom
- Automatic reverse dependency order removal
- `--dry-run` support to preview what will be removed
- Interactive confirmation before removal
- Safe rollback only for completed installations

**📊 Bundle History System**
- New `BundleHistory` type for tracking installations
- `BundleHistoryEntry` records each installation with:
  - Bundle name and installed items
  - Installation timestamp and user
  - Status (Completed/Partial/Failed)
  - Rollback availability flag
- Persistent storage with JSON format
- Automatic directory creation

**🛡️ Safety Features**
- Only completed bundles can be rolled back
- Partial/failed installations are tracked but not rolled back
- Interactive prompt before removing packages
- Graceful handling of already-removed packages
- Detailed status reporting during rollback

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- Added `BundleStatus` enum (Completed/Partial/Failed)
- Added `BundleHistoryEntry` and `BundleHistory` types
- Implemented bundle history load/save with JSON serialization
- Updated `apply_bundle()` to track installations
- Added `rollback()` function with reverse-order removal
- CLI command structure extended with Rollback subcommand

### 📦 Example Usage

```bash
# Install a bundle (now tracked for rollback)
annactl apply --bundle "Python Development Stack"

# See what would be removed
annactl rollback --bundle "Python Development Stack" --dry-run

# Rollback a bundle
annactl rollback --bundle "Python Development Stack"

# View installation history
cat /var/lib/anna/bundle_history.json
```

### 💡 How It Works

1. **Installation Tracking**: When you install a bundle, Anna records:
   - Which items were installed
   - Timestamp and username
   - Success/failure status

2. **Reverse Order Removal**: Rollback removes items in reverse dependency order:
   - If you installed: Docker → docker-compose → lazydocker
   - Rollback removes: lazydocker → docker-compose → Docker

3. **Safety First**: Only fully completed bundles can be rolled back, preventing partial rollbacks that could break dependencies.

## [1.0.0-beta.28] - 2025-01-04

- Suggests installing AUR helper if you have AUR packages but no helper
- Recommends paru over yay for users with 20+ AUR packages (faster, Rust-based)
- Offers 3 alternatives with trade-offs explained

**💾 Package Cache Intelligence**
- Monitors `/var/cache/pacman/pkg/` size with `du`
- Warns when cache exceeds 5GB
- Suggests `paccache` for safe cleanup
- Offers 3 cleanup strategies:
  - Keep last 3 versions (safe default)
  - Keep last 1 version (aggressive, saves more space)
  - Remove all uninstalled packages
- Auto-suggests installing `pacman-contrib` if needed

**🔧 Kernel Parameter Optimization**
- Parses `/proc/cmdline` for current boot parameters
- Suggests `noatime` for SSD systems (reduces wear)

     NetworkManager-wait-online delays boot waiting for network.
     Most systems don't need this.

     ❯ systemctl disable NetworkManager-wait-online.service
```

**Package Cache Cleanup Example:**
```
[23] Package cache is large (8.4 GB)
     RECOMMENDED   LOW RISK

     Alternatives:
     ★ Keep last 3 versions - Safe default
     ○ Keep last 1 version - More aggressive
     ○ Remove uninstalled packages
```
