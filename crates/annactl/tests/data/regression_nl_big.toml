# Beta.248: Large NL QA Regression Suite
# ========================================
#
# This suite contains 250 real-world system questions focused on:
# - System health and status queries
# - Resource monitoring (CPU, RAM, disk, services)
# - Diagnostic and troubleshooting queries
# - Natural language variants
#
# Sources:
# - tests/qa/questions_archlinux.jsonl (20 questions)
# - Synthesized system health questions (230 questions)
# - Based on patterns from Beta.241-245 routing improvements
#
# Format:
# [[test]] - Test case
# id - Unique identifier
# query - Natural language question
# expect_route - Expected routing: "diagnostic", "status", "conversational"
# expect_contains - Optional: substrings that should appear in answer
# notes - Optional: Context or source information

# ============================================================================
# SECTION 1: SYSTEM HEALTH AND STATUS (Primary diagnostic/status routes)
