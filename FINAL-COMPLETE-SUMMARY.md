## 🎯 Next Steps (Action Required)

### 1. Monitor Build (NOW)

Go to: https://github.com/jjgarcianorway/anna-assistant/actions

**Look for:** Release workflow for v0.13.2

**Expected:**
- ✅ Build starts
- ✅ Rust installed
- ✅ Project compiled
- ✅ Binaries created
- ✅ Archive created
- ✅ Release published

**If it succeeds:** Skip to step 3
**If it fails:** Check the error logs, I'll help fix it

---

### 2. If Build Fails - Check Logs

Look for errors in:
- "Build release binary" step
- Compilation errors
- Missing dependencies

**Common issues:**
- Rust code doesn't compile
- Missing Cargo.lock file
- Dependency issues

---

### 3. Once Build Succeeds - Test Installer

```bash
# Clean environment
cd anna-assistant
rm -rf bin/

# Test installer
./scripts/install.sh

# Should output:
# → Fetching latest release from GitHub...
# ✓ Latest release: v0.13.2
# → Downloading binaries...
# ✓ Downloaded and installed!
```

---

### 4. Future Releases (After First Success)

```bash
# Make changes...
vim src/main.rs

# Release with ONE command:
./scripts/release.sh -t patch -m "Bug fixes" --yes

# Done! Wait ~5-10 minutes for build
# Then users can: ./scripts/install.sh
```

---

## 📖 Quick Reference

```bash
# Release (most common)
./scripts/release.sh -t patch -m "Your changes" --yes

# Install (users)
./scripts/install.sh

# Uninstall
./scripts/uninstall.sh

# Help
./scripts/install.sh --help
./scripts/release.sh --help
```

## 📋 Workflow Comparison

### Before This Session
```bash
# Developer (you):
vim src/...
cargo build
cargo test
git add -A
git commit -m "..."
git push
vim Cargo.toml  # Manual version bump
vim install.sh  # Manual version bump
vim PKGBUILD    # Manual version bump
git add -A
git commit -m "bump version"
git tag -a v0.X.X
git push
git push --tags
# Wait for users to manually download and compile

# User:
git clone ...
sudo pacman -S rust
cargo build --release  # 5+ minutes
sudo install binaries
... many manual steps ...
```

### After This Session
```bash
# Developer (you):
vim src/...
./scripts/release.sh -t patch -m "Changes" --yes
# Done! Everything automatic.

# User:
./scripts/install.sh
# Done! Downloads and installs automatically.
```

**Time saved per release:** ~30 minutes → 10 seconds
**User installation time:** ~10 minutes → 30 seconds
**Manual steps:** 15+ → 1
