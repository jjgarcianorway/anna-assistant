# GitHub Actions Troubleshooting

## The Problem

Tags are being pushed successfully, but NO releases are being created.

This means GitHub Actions is either:
1. Not enabled on the repository
2. Not running at all
3. Running but failing silently

---

## Step 1: Check if GitHub Actions is Enabled

1. **Go to your repository:** https://github.com/jjgarcianorway/anna-assistant

2. **Click the "Actions" tab** at the top

3. **What do you see?**

### If you see: "Get started with GitHub Actions"
→ **Actions are NOT enabled**

**Fix:**
- Click "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"
- Or go to Settings → Actions → General
- Enable "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"

### If you see: A list of workflow runs
→ **Actions ARE enabled**

**Check the runs:**
- Look for recent runs with names like "Release"
- Click on any failed runs
- Check the error logs

---

## Step 2: Check Workflow Runs

If Actions are enabled, look for runs tagged with your versions:

- v0.13.5
- v0.13.4
- v0.13.3
- etc.

**What's their status?**

- ❌ **Failed** - Click to see error logs
- ⏸️ **Skipped** - Workflow didn't trigger
- ✅ **Success** - Should have created a release

---

## Step 3: Common Issues

### Issue 1: Workflow Permissions

**Check:** Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions

**Should be:**
- ✅ "Read and write permissions" selected
- ✅ "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" checked

### Issue 2: Repository is Private

If your repository is private, the GitHub API might return 404 for unauthenticated requests.

**This is OK!** The workflows should still run.

### Issue 3: Rust Build Failing

The Rust project might not compile. Common reasons:

- Missing `Cargo.lock` file (we have this issue!)
- Compilation errors in the Rust code
- Dependency resolution failures

---

## Step 4: Test if Actions Work At All

I've created a simple test workflow: `.github/workflows/test.yml`

**To test:**

1. Commit and push the test workflow:
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/test.yml
   git commit -m "test: add simple workflow test"
   git push
   ```

2. Go to Actions tab

3. Look for "Test Workflow" run

4. If it runs successfully → Actions work!
   If it doesn't run → Actions not enabled

---

## Step 5: What to Report Back

Please check the above and tell me:

1. **Is GitHub Actions enabled?** (Yes/No)

2. **Do you see workflow runs?** (Yes/No)

3. **If yes, what's their status?**
   - All failed?
   - All skipped?
   - Some succeeded?

4. **If failed, what's the error?**
   - Copy the error message from the logs
   - Or tell me which step failed

---

## Quick Check Commands

Run these and share the output:

```bash
# Check if workflows directory exists
ls -la .github/workflows/

# Check remote repository
git remote -v

# Check recent tags
git tag | tail -5
```

---

## Most Likely Issues

Based on what we've seen:

1. **GitHub Actions not enabled** (most likely!)
   - Fix: Enable in repository settings

2. **Rust code doesn't compile**
   - Need to see build logs to diagnose

3. **Workflow file has issues**
   - Already updated to latest action versions

---

## Next Steps

Once you check the above and let me know what you find, I can:

- Fix workflow issues
- Help resolve Rust build errors
- Create a workaround
- Or provide pre-compiled binaries manually

For now, **please check the GitHub Actions tab** and let me know what you see!
